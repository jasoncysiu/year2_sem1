"SUMMARY:  Had a alien possible abduction ,very hard to talk about it. Remember hearing  buzzing sound and 6 small grey figures that  passed out.I woke up at 3am and was just laying there ,when I heard this buzzing sound outside and really didn&apos;t think much about it , it keep getting louder and louder until it was in the room and I sat up in bed to see if something was wrong in the bedroom .  I was fully awake...  I just feel asleep like right away , but as I was closing my eyes I saw 6 small grey figures and felt something touch my leg and arms.  When I woke up it was 6am and I felt like I wanted to be afraid but couldn&apos;t , I have a lot of trouble understanding what happen..

"Summary : sleepover. flashing lights. blankets ripped off bed. tall thin figures &quot;spoke&quot; to us. abduction. woke with strange triangular marks on our bodies that vanished within hours. constant feeling of being watched. S.O.S.Me and my friend are 14 years old.  We had stayed up late studying for finals.  We went to bed at about 12 and stayed up till about 1 afeter talking about school.  At about 2 we were both awakened suddenly to a strange silence and bright flashing lights out side the window.  We both remember a sence of absolute shock and severe fright, when our covers were suddenly and yet gently drawn from our beds.  At the foot of my bed I saw a   the silouette of a tall thin figure with  large black eyes that had a shiney luster to them, it was as if I could see myself in them,(after this moment I regret to say that the rest is the account of my friend because I cannot remember anything else)......I looked over at Patty and I remember thinking that she was dead because she lie so still.  her body began to rise above the bed into the arms of the figure described above. I also was &quot;carried&quot; into the figures arms, but i did not pass out. Before I knew it, we were in a different place that is defficult to describe because i was surrounded by these figures.  I was laying on a strange surface that was both hot and cold at the same time. It felt as if there was a sheet over my body put there so that i could not move.  The only part of my body that i could move was my eyes.  I did not see Patty anywhere, until the beings parted for a split second, and i caught sight of them carrying her body out of the room, i was sure she was dead. i then directed my eyes toward the celing and saw an  object slowly and silently descending toward my stomach.  It resembled a very large needle, and it was then that i fainted.  i awoke in the morning laying beside Patty on the kitchen floor. We vaguely (at first) remembered what had happened.  We noticed three strange triangular marks on our bodies--one behind the left ear, one on our stomachs, and one on our lower back.  Now Patty and i feel that if we ever separate after this experience together, somthing bad will happen."
"Summary : Observed two objects. One with flashing multi-colored lights, the second, somewhat bell-shaped with two white-yellow lights. They hovered above us and appeared to be observing us.On May 10, 1997 we were camping in a remote part of Los Padres National Forest. Our party consisted of myself, my wife ((Three names deleted)). Our location was a campsite known as Thorn Meadows, approximately 20 miles west of the small town of Lake of the Woods, in Ventura county. The elevation there is approximately 4000 ft., the winds were calm, the sky was clear, the stars were bright. A crescent moon was descending. We had camped at this site on two other occasions and although it is very remote, this was the first time we had not seen any other people in the area all day.At approximately 10:45 PM, we were finishing cleaning up after dinner. We had a fire burning. ((Name deleted)), pointing to the northeastern sky, said something to effect of, &quot;Hey, what is that thing? I&rsquo;ve been watching it for a while and I can&rsquo;t figure out what it is.&quot; I looked in the direction he was pointing and I saw a flashing light, at approximately 50 degrees. At first I thought it was someone walking down the hill with a flashlight because of the erratic way it was flashing. I then realised that this could not be because there was no hill in that direction. After watching it for approx. 30 seconds, I realised two things: one, the flashing light it was emitting was rapidly changing color; two, it was moving in an unpredictable, erratic manner that could not possibly have been an airplane or helicopter. It was moving in a way that seemed to indicate it was searching for something. At that instant, I realised immediately it was not an ordinary aircraft. The object then changed dire!ction and came directly at us in a straight line moving at a high rate of speed which I could not quantify. The object then stopped in plain view, at roughly the same angle to the horizon. I found this very disturbing. Then ((Name deleted)) said, &quot;Look, there&rsquo;s another one.&quot; I turned my head and saw to the southeast, at approximately 30 degrees, another object that had, to me, appeared out of nowhere and was now hovering almost directly above us. This object was different from the other, it had two bright, white-yellow lights and seemed vaguely bell-shaped. Both objects were completely silent and up there you can hear a plane from miles away. I had the distinct but inexplicable sense that they were looking at us. I could not estimate the size or altitude of the objects, but the second object had a similar appearance to a helicopter hovering at maybe 1500 ft. In other words, it was clearly visible.I was quite frightened but ((Name deleted))was absolutely terror-stricken. She was completely resolute that we needed to leave immediately. Seeing the second object sitting up above us was all I needed to make up my mind to go. In seconds we gathered up the dogs, extinguished the fire and got in the truck and I drove as fast as I could down the dirt road. At one point, my wife saw the first object off to the right of our vehicle and believes it was following us. I did not see it and so cannot verify. Later I realised that we were in a classic abduction scenario and I&rsquo;m glad we left, although I wonder if I would have had it not been for my wife&rsquo;s urging. I also realise that if they really wanted us, we wouldn&rsquo;t have had a chance. We spent the night in a motel room in town and went back early in the morning to gather up our things.Let me give you some background here for a frame of reference. I am a skeptical person by nature. In my youth I heard the stories of UFOs and thought, &quot;Well, that could be, but I&rsquo;ll believe it when I see it.&quot; Then, a number of years ago I read Communion which led to my reading a few other books on the subject. Then I realised what was really going on. However, I am most certainly not one of those people that goes around trying to spot UFOs, in fact the opposite is true. After reading Communion, I hoped to never see one of those things. I have spent a lot of time looking at the night sky and have never, until now, seen anything that was completely inexplicable. I am convinced that there is no way these objects that we witnessed could have been some experimental aircraft. The way they accelerated, stopped, changed direction, I don&rsquo;t believe that a human would be able to withstand the g forces that would have been generated."
"Summary : My neighbor said I disapeared of the front stoop of my house,There was a day during the summer in the mid 60&apos;s when my dad called me over while he was talking to our neighbor across the street. My father said that my neighbor, ((Name deleted)), was telling him that he was upset over the fact that I literally disappeared from off my front stoop. I stood there and looked at him.  How could I have disappeared off of my stoop??  I told him that things like that do not happen. He said it did. He said he was working in his yard, he saw me sitting on the stoop,  he turned his head for a second, and when he looked back I was gone.  I said he must have been mistaken. I said I must have gone into the house.  He said that there was not enough time..he said he just looked away for a second. He was really upset about it. I dismissed the entire thing as something he THOUGHT he saw,  and forgot about it.  Who ever heard of abductions during the &apos;60&apos;s. We had sightings, but that was about it. Many years have passed and now the UFO information we have has grown and opened up many new avenues of thought.  One of these is abductions. As I was first learning about this during the early &apos;90&apos;s, I suddenly had a flashback to that conversation in the street with my dad and our neighbor. But I had no memory of any abduction..I still don&apos;t.  But what I do have is a very strange memory puzzle that fits together..and it has to do with me being on my front stoop. When I put put these three pieces together, I came up with this strange story.  Piece one had to do with me sitting on my front stoop. I saw a light coming from out of the north headed in my general direction. I thought it was a jet. To think about it now why didn&apos;t I see the body of the jet..it was broad daylight on a summer afternoon. I watched the light seem to slow down and suddenly shoot off to the east. I remember saying..wow,  a ufo. That was the first piece of memory I have had floating in my head. The second was a memory of me being on the stoop,  and suddenly I felt like absolute garbage.  I was nausious and felt a little dizzy.  I had no clue what was wrong. I tried to get up.  I figured I would go lie down on the patio lounge.  As I got up I felt worse..I was completely disoriented. I staggered towards the gate to go into my back yard and wound up in the garage standing by my bike wondering what was the matter with me.  I finally made it to the lounge, and I remember my mother telling me later that I slept for about two hours or so. IF..these pieces belong together, the picture looks like this.  I was on the stoop.  I saw the UFO coming. It slowed down.  I was grabbed and my neighbor witnessed it even though he looked away for a second.  I was returned, saw the UFO leave..and then the sick disorientation set in. From there I walked in a disoriented state, from my stoop..to the garage..to the lounge chair and slept for hours. I now know that this has been going on in my life since the mid &apos;50&apos;s.  As a child I had little people in my room that would advance toward my bed...and that was all I remember. I have had visitors in my teens and adult life. I have managed to pull all of these memories that have been floating in my head for years as undefined strange events,  together to make sense of it all.  The only one I did not understand until fairly recently, was the inner nagging drive to study a particular topic. I had no idea why,  since I was 5 or so, that I had to study this topic. The information did not appear in my life until my early 20&apos;s. It continued in dribs and drabs straight to today. All of this info is on my 20 page web site. http://www.((address deleted)).HTM That&apos;s my story."
"[Diary of my Encounters This is the story I have known since 1979. In 1979 I was holiday ing at a place called Berowra waters on the South coast near Sussex Inlet with five friends&apos; one of whose father owned the caravan park where we stayed.This caravan park is on a cliff overlooking the pacific ocean and we would go to the beach everyday and spend most of the day their swimming, surfing and sunbaking.On this particular day I was standing on the shore with my friends father and mother who owned the caravan park when we looked towards the water facing south-east on a clear hot day( no clouds) and observed a black metallic mass that looked similar to an aircraft carrier on its side (approx length 1500ft long-200-400ft across) and slowly moving towards a cliff face which eventually hid most of the object but not before we discussed what it was and how something that big could stay airbo rne when it was apparently moving so slowly and not making a sound.The object was approx: less than three miles away travelling at two to five miles an hour and started to slowly move in a westerly direction over land, it seemed to take so long to move out of view that other people on the beach had by this time noticed what we were looking at and started to point in the air and their was approx ten to twenty people who saw the same thing up and down the beach.As owner of the caravan park numerous people asked them what it was and they responded that they didn&rsquo;t know, only that their was a Navy facility further down the coast, and Airforce Base at Nowra (ALBATROSS)The object (and it was a metal object)stayed in view for over half an hour from the time we first noticed it until it was lost behind the cliff face. We then proceed to climb the cliff to see if it could still be seen and their it was hovering for a considerable amount of time until a helicopter &amp; jet could be heard in the vicinity, and it slowly moved away, but not taking any notice of either helicopter or jet.In the meantime the southcoast radio station had been inundated with phone calls about strange bright white craft (and they did say craft, I was listening to the broadcast to see if anyone had reported what we had seen earlier) people described the objects, and up to ten were seen, as flying up and down the coast in pairs and one at a time, out to sea, and close to land, as being as bright as the sun, and reflecting the sun, and travelling very fast and occasionally turning back towards the way they had come. When I heard this I remember thinking that this was not what we had seen as the objects were to small, (the size of a houses I seem to remember) not the size of an aircraft carrier as we had seen a few hours earlier. The reports on the radio were the same day, only hours apart from our encounter.My impression was that this was a controlled event as this was winter holidays and the weather was so beautiful that thousands of people were at the beaches up and down the coast, the two people who were with me, and, owned the caravan park were well known in the area ,he was on the local council and had lived in the area all of there lives, and even had a street named after them, and were very honest and humble people who had never seen anything like it in their life, they were also aware of the military bases locally and had seen experimental aircraft before fly over the region, including Jets. I was seventeen at the time I am now thirty five and this was a very close sighting of a very immense object that moved extremely slow and showed no signs of external movement, but it had what appeared to be rivets or welding on the bottom on the side which faced us.At the time I really thought that this was not anything which had been manufactured in Australia and never once thought this was from outer space, now I&rsquo;m not so sure.Conclusion : Large black mass the size of an aircraft carrier: Moved slowly without sound: Stayed in view for a considerable amount of time: Was seen by numerous people: Weather was hot and cloudless: Other objects were also seen: Radio station reported strange craft seen up and down the coast: Object and smaller objects made of solid material: Reported to authorities: Was highly unusualThe Next time (also 1979)In the same year a few friends of mine decided to go to a lookout near Baulkham Hills  in the west of Sydney which was about to become a new suburb, the time was approximately 7.00 - 8.30 PM in summer, (daylight saving ) late November and was a clear night with no clouds, we had been their for a short time when I noticed three circular bright red lights moving south (coming from a northerly direction) in a controlled movement, they were approximately less than five miles away and at that distance appeared to be quite large, about the size of a average house and were moving in a orderly fashion and in no hurry, they were moving in a triangular motion, travelling about 3-10 miles an hour.They did no abrupt moves and stayed in the same formation for a long time (20-30min) before they seemed to reach a point near Prospect Reservoir, and one dived towards the ground at a tremendous speed, one left skyward at high speed, and the other one just seemed to dissolve into the night. We turned the radio on and 2WS, which is a local radio station reported that they had received phone calls from people asking what the lights could be.I asked one of my friends who was there, recently, did he remember that particular night and he described the exact things I have just explained, and he said that they seemed to be under some kind of control and maybe connected to each other as they did a peculiar pattern as they moved across the sky, but the same pattern right across the sky.Conclusion : Three Bright Red Lights with some kind of shape (circular): In a fixed formation (triangular): Seen by five people for a period of at least 20 min: Was reported on the radio by others, independent people: Disappeared  within seconds of each other: Cloudless viewing.Eleven Years Later (1990)I had just returned from Florida, in the States, earlier in the year and had recently lost my job and found myself with time on my hands so I decided to be involved in this new craze which was sweeping the globe 3D images.I managed to find a job in the city (Sydney, Australia) and was working selling 3D posters at Central Railway Station, literally. This was around Christmas 1990 and they were very popular, on this particular day which was a Monday I was just about to go to lunch when a rather tall gentleman of about 6ft 10in, tall, and with large features, long White hair and looking very much like an American Indian, remarked to me that his friend thought  that the brain was similar to a 3D image and the universal acceptance of these images had some kind of lost meaning which we were about to grasp again after a very long time.He then brought up the subject of his friend who had worked for NASA as a photographer and had a very high clearance in the military and had been asked to photograph the inside and outside of a Circular craft which had somehow come into the possession of NASA. He told me in no uncertain terms that his friend took photos of the objects door and as he moved inside and looked  back towards the outside that the door was now twenty to thirty feet higher and the inside was of immense size, yet from the outside the door and craft were rather small, he also me about the underground  nuclear test explosion which was apparently detonated to contain alien forces who had Killed up to 25 scientists and 44 military elite who had complained of human abductions, we had talked so long that I missed my lunch break, and I was working 12 hour days so what he had been telling me had taken nearly one hour, a friend of mine who had come into to see me stood their for the whole time and told me after!wards that what he had just said was really over the top but very interesting.The next day a Tuesday I was sitting in the top floor of a double decker train at 6.30 in the morning on my way to work, the train had just left Strathfield station when I noticed in the distance, a shape like a plane that seemed to be banking towards the train, I was looking for markings and wings as I thought it was a plane making a turn towards the airport when it suddenly approached parallel to the train and proceeded to pace the train.Most people who were on the train were asleep and I had an urge to wake them and say look out the window at this silvery disk shaped object which had by now slowed considerably and was now only one mile away and slowing down as we slowed down as we approached the next stop, the train had just slowed down for track maintenance when I noticed a tower between the object and the train, by the time we passed the tower which was about thirty feet across, the object had disappeared from view, as if someone had turned a switch and the object had just disappearedConclusion   : Strange encounter with person with Indian like appearance: Told me about something which I had heard years earlier underground: Observed a craft of no known origin the next day: Had seen it disappear before my eyes on a clear day: Was definitely metallic and polished silver - reflected the early morning sunlight: Had no markings whatsoever: No exhaust or smoke at all: Was seen for 10-15 minIn early (1993)Near the middle of April I was at a friends place in Blacktown ( 25 miles West of Sydney) we had just been outside and had seen a bright red object shining in a westerly direction at a very high altitude and not doing the normal flight you would expect from any aircraft, this lasted about five minutes before we lost it behind a tree, there were three of us, at about one hour after this I decided to go home, the time was about 10-11 PM.I lived about three miles away and on the way home had a Incredible encounter with multiple craft over Blacktown (where I live) it started when I reached the top of a hill on Locke St and was stopped at a set of traffic lights and noticed directly ahead less than a mile away a Huge Object, and smaller craft above the main one, the lights changed and I proceeded down the hill past the local hospital, and as I rounded the corner I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was seeing, their above the road less than five -hundred feet away I saw two objects- One, the bigger of the two had lights of different shades and colours which moved around the base and middle in a fast movement so that the lights seemed to catch up with each other and I could see what seemed to be railings inside the craft, the lights which were luminous colours-Green-washed in purples and yellows with a touch of Blue. There seemed to be a bright light coming from inside the large object.The object above the larger one had to be large also but wasn&rsquo;t doing anything other than sitting above the other one, I slowed down at another set of lights and saw a elderly gentleman who was walking along the footpath and I was going to wind down my window and ask him to look up at the Objects but thought  he might have a heart attack so I didn&rsquo;t say anything, while I was waiting for the lights to change they started to slowly move away over the hospital and I thought to myself that I was going to chase them ( the objects) at that very second as if they had heard what I had thought they accelerated to a brisk pace and I turned around and started to chase them, as I drove up the hill and turned east down Bungarribee Rd I stopped my car which overlooked a disused quarry and got out I notice two more objects hovering above my head at no more than 200ft above me, I then looked East and about half a mile away noticed another two cigar shaped objects the same as the ones above my!head, I then looked to the south and saw another object similar to the one above the large object that I was chasing and saw the two craft I was chasing moving at a slow speed in a south-easterly direction, in the direction of Bankstown Airport about fifteen miles away.While I was watching them both move away the two above me were still there not moving at all, I was out of the car and could almost touch them, they made no sound and seemed to just hover without any wobbling or movement, I continued to watch all seven objects for the next hour or so until the first two disappeared in the vicinity of Sydney and seemed to be moving in a large arc around the panoramic view I had (that is moving from south to east to nth east before I lost sight of them) I then noticed that the two smaller cigar shaped objects to the east had come down a bit lower and were near a radio tower 2WS and soon they too had mysteriously vanished, the objects above my head had begun to move away slowly and I saw that they were staying close together and moved slowly towards the horizon until they too had disappeared.I decided to go home and ring up the airport where I had seen the original two craft head towards, when I arrived home I had to move my mothers car under the carport, but, when I tried to start the car it wouldn&rsquo;t start, I finally gave up and got out of the car and looked up at the sky and the first craft I had seen with the revolving lights was directly above our house and was moving very slowly south back towards the location that I had first seen it, It was the same craft except I now had a better look at the whole Object, It was Large about 200ft in diameter and when I looked up was moving quite slowly almost as if it was waiting for something to catch it up. It then moved out of site and I went inside and rang up the airport who rang me three days later and asked me what I had seen and told me to ring the Airforce base at Richmond which I did and the person I talked to said that they had heard nothing about what I had just described.I left a message for my mother that her car wouldn&rsquo;t start and she rang the NRMA which is road service in New South Wales and when he turned up the car wouldn&rsquo;t start straight away and he said that it was a flat battery even though it was a new battery and the car had been driven less than four hours earlier that night.Conclusion   : Seven Objects seen in the space of a few hundred feet from each other: Coloured Lights seen emitting from around the Largest Object: Objects seen to Hover from a close distance: Seemed to hear what I was thinking: Some kind of railing seen inside large object: Bright White Light seen emitting from inside: Travelled right around the Metropolitan area: Somehow drained the power from the battery of car: Seen directly over my house so object had to of flown in a 360 deg arc around Sydney and surrounding areas: I had chased the first two objects which had been hovering over road near the HospitalBedroom Visitors 1994I had just arrived home from a friends place and was lying on the bed looking at the ceiling and looking out the window at the stars when I felt a sharp pain like a pin being stuck in my toes, the first thing I thought was that a white tailed spider had bitten me as there was an increase in these type of spiders around the house at the time.I felt like I was frozen and wanted to yell out but didn&rsquo;t want to disturb my mother who was asleep in the other room, I was wide awake and had only just put my head on the pillow seconds earlier thinking about tomorrow and things I had to do, when I felt the presence in my room and sounds from the foot of my bed, I couldn&rsquo;t see anything, and I still couldn&rsquo;t move at all and it was then that I felt hands around my feet where the pin prick had been and I could only lift my head slightly and I saw five small figures looking at me at the foot of the bed (they had came out of my wardrobe) and I could see that the wall where the wardrobe was now different and looked like the inside of a giant hanger which went back into the wall a considerable distance.There were two small entities standing at the end of my bed and one had stuck me with a needle in the toe and one was holding my ankle and examining my ankle area, while this was happening I thought that I hope my mother in the next room doesn&rsquo;t wake up and disturbs these entities as they might panic and hurt her, or she might panic and something bad might happen to her, then what seemed like a few seconds I noticed three more figures coming out of the wardrobe and stand at the foot of the bed and proceeded to stick something in my leg, I started to feel able to move again, only slightly and lifted my head off the pillow and saw right into their faces and they looked back with curious looks on their faces but never stopped doing whatever they were doing but they knew I was looking straight at them and I was wide awake.They were not trying to intentionally hurt me and I felt no fear and I could remember everything that they were doing and I was aware of  being awake and this was not a dream, I tried to communicate with them, I couldn&rsquo;t talk, as no sounds came from my mouth, but I could hear my voice from deep down from within.They were quite solid, long arms but not abnormal, smallish heads not extremely large, more like small children feeling around, playing, around 3-4ft tall, dark greyish in appearance with lizard like scales, and the skin seemed the same colour throughout the body as far as I could see, and I could see just below their knees, they had a almost sad look about them and there was definitely some kind of rank as one or two ordered the others around, not with words or telepathy but they just seemed to obey without answering, and these other two stayed in the background moving around the room and observing, occasionally looking over to see what was happening.They still had hold of my ankle and reminded me of well trained doctors with nurses helping them, this was a real event, on one occasion one stepped back into the wardrobe to retrieve something and came back with it in its hand and I noticed that it had three large type fingers that seemed to be too large to do anything intricate yet here they were doing things to me with the skill of a surgeon, I felt no pain except for the initial discomfort of a pinprick in my toe, I heard no voices only muffled sounds and yet I could tell that this wasn&rsquo;t going to be a adverse experience.They wanted to look at my legs and feet and didn&rsquo;t come near my face or touch any part of me except my toes and ankles, although they had direct contact with my eyes. They seemed to me to be quite aware of my feelings and as they continued  they would look my way to see if I was in any discomfort and all looked when I thought of my mother, before they left I noticed they looked back at me as they went back into the wardrobe, one at a time, in a very orderly fashion, and the last thing before they vanished the wall came back to its original distance and the hanger like area which reminded me of inside a large ship gradually disappeared in a cloud like vapour.It was then that I felt the sensation of my foot and toe and I immediately jumped up and went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror and could see that I was wide awake and when I checked the time it was less than three minutes since I had arrived home, which was impossible as I had made something to eat when I first arrived home.It was then when I heard my mother talk that I realised it was all over and I have since sold the wardrobe and painted the room and had a inbuilt wardrobe installed.Later in the week I went to a friend who has a paranormal interest and he took out of my toe a small black object that wasas hard as a needle and was giving me quite a bit of pain.Conclusion : Five Entities in my bedroom: A small metal as hard as a needle was found in my toe: I was wide awake the whole time: There was eye contact and concern on their part: I saw a kind of entrance to another dimension: Some type of medical procedure had happened: Two entities in charge of procedures: Grey in appearance with skin that was like a mold: They knew what to do and had me paralysed from the neck down.: They also had a sad look- the kind of look when you say goodbye to someone you have feelings forEarly (1996)I had just came home and was going inside to  get my telescope to look at Jupiter and the Moon when I looked west and saw a fast moving object which I thought was a white aeroplane that looked like a wireframe, until I saw a smaller object either come out of the original object or came up alongside and seemed to refuel while all the time the other object was moving at a incredible speed. They stayed together for approximately 15 seconds which was a long time considering it travelled across the horizon and out of sight in that time.I rang Bankstown Airport and they told me to ring Richmond Airforce Base which I immediately did and was put through to the officer in charge of aircraft dispatches who told me that no planes would refuel over residential areas Ever and especially not at night. I know what I saw and that was a low, very high speed object with a smaller object that was seen to pace and be refuelled in mid air at about 11PM at night earlier this year 1996.Conclusion : High speed Object wireframe in appearance: Smaller Object seen to pace and be refuelled by larger object: In view for a short amount of time: Incredible speeds for both craft: Large Craft was white in appearance: Smaller Craft seemed to be see through.JUNE LONG WEEKEND (9/6/96)Sun: Time: 9.25-9.55This happened on Sun long weekend of June this year I had just dropped Lloyd who is a friend of mine at his place and he was taking his things inside when I noticed three orange/red/yellow lights pulsating and slowly moving high in the sky above Blacktown. They were in a large Triangular shape from three to five files apart, the top light of the triangle stayed in a constant spot as did the bottom left light, the light on the bottom right though moved away and pulsated in and out and disappeared on occasions and then reappeared slowly moving away from the other two until it completely disappeared from view. The other two started to slowly move away with the bottom left light going higher and the top light moving across and over the bottom light, moving east and moving very slowly, the other light moved away at the same speed going north-east and very slowly. We decided to ring a few friends who have cameras and videos and after a good half hour with the objects still in sight !I decided to go home as it was getting quite cold. We were looking through high powered binoculars and their appeared to be a solid object behind the light. As I drove home which is about two miles away I could see the remaining lights from the car quite clearly and thought that when I arrive home I would have a look through the telescope. When I arrived at my house both objects could still be seen very easily by the naked eye and through the telescope I could see that their was a light in the centre of the mass which was causing the brightness, I watched both for a considerable time until the light that was moving slowly to the north-east had stopped and had taken on the appearance of a star and was now acting as though it was stationary so I turned my attention to the other light which was now over the Windsor area travelling north-west but was still in sight for a considerable time before it was just a blur and by which time it was  icy cold, I turned the telescope again to!wards the first light and it was just sitting there stationary as a star would look, I then went to bed and when I went to work the next day I asked Lloyd if they took any pictures and he proceeded to tell me what happened later that night in front of at least seven people.After I left his friends turned up but the objects had been gone for a while before they turned up, so they went to another friends place just around the corner and this is three different accounts of what happened next starting with:"
"Large elipsoid object (greenish hugh) hovering and slowly moving forward just above the treeline (approx. 150 feet) in Los Gatos foothills.I was eleven years old.  Standing on my driveway in the rustic Los Gatos Foothills with my younger brother (9 at the time) and neighbor (16 at the time).  We were talking... then both of their mouths fell open.  I turned to see what was going on.  A large elipsoidal object (about the size of a 1/4 mile running track oval was hovering toward us (very slowly) just above the sycamore trees (approx. 150 feet).  We all stood in silence and awe for a minute as the object moved almost directly over head. I ran into my house to get a camera.  Here&apos;s where it gets weird... .  I asked my mother for a camera (we had two olk kodak&apos;s in a drawer) and she forgot where they were (my mother knows exactly where everything is in her house, she&apos;s meticulous like that)  I went to the drawer where the cameras were and pulled one out.  My mother stopped me saying she didn&apos;t know if it had film in it.  I thought it did and took it and ran through the house to go outside.  (It gets weirder now)  I ran through the television room where my father was watching a rerun of Gilligan&apos;s Island (he never watches the show, doesn&apos;t like it much, BUT it was MY FAVORITE SHOW)  I had the thought that the object/UFO was now gone and sat down to watch the show (which I had seen many times before).  When the show ended... I saw that I had a camera in my hand and couldn&apos;t figure out why.  I thought hard and knew that there was something &quot;really important&quot; that I was forgetting.  I remembered the UFO and a wave of terror came over me.  I ran outside to see if it was still there. I found my younger brother and neighbor exactly where I had left them.  Only now they had been joined by two other neighborhood kids (I believe 18 and 19 years old at that time).  The UFO was no longer there.  I asked where it went.  They asked &quot;where did what go?&quot;  I said, &quot;The UFO, where did it go?&quot;.  They said &quot;oh, that, it took off real fast, but that was a while ago&quot; (all four of them saw it leave). I find it odd that they shrugged it off as if it was no big deal. A few years later I was with my mother in a local shopping mall.  I went into a bookstore to find her.  The book &quot;Communion&quot; had just come out and wsa displayed in the store.  I literally was scared for my life when I saw the cover... I was terrified that the alien on the cover was going to kill me.  Now, I&apos;d never seen a picture of a Grey up to that point in my life.  And I had no idea that it was an alien.  Non-the-less, I ran out of the bookstore and sat outside for 1/2 an hour scared to go back in and see the image of the alien. Was I abducted?  I don&apos;t know. All I know is I saw that UFO (or at least something without wings or propellers)  when I was a kid.  And I was terrified of the picture on a book cover."
"A sighting of a craft and alien abduction experienceI was taking a nap in the evening at the above date.  I was about 6 months pregnant at the time.  I woke up and saw a large craft outside the upstairs window of an A frame structure located in a wooded around.  My husband saw it too.  For some reason I fainted or went out.  I heard a voice with a thick middle eastern accent tell me to open my eyes.  I thought to myself, &quot;why would Mark, my husband, tell me to open my eyes. I said no.  The voice said you must.  I finally did after the voice spoke firmly.  What I saw I had never before seen.  It looked like an insect. It was thin and white wearing a dark suite, more like a robe.  It spoke without moving its lips.  I couldn&apos;t tell who was talking to me because there was more than one.  The others were wearing jumpsuits. He kept telling me to look at him, but I didn&apos;t want to and I kept shutting my eyes.  He said I must not fear him but I kept screaming and hyperventilating.  He kept saying he would not harm me and I must believe that.  He kept looking closely in my eyes or at my pupils.  I asked him what he was .  Was he a snake ?  He said no, I am not a reptile.  Then I asked if he were a insect.  He told me to look at his arms and said something about his joints and were they like an insect?  I asked him if he were going to kill me or eat me.  He said,  Why? do you think you would taste good?  This may sound like I am joking, but truly I am not. I kept screaming and shutting my eyes.  I was on some sort of table, I know, your classic alien experience.  The others around me starting backing away. The taller alien, the one in the robe told them That is the fear, that is the fear you smell.  It was awful.  I kept going in and out and I was afraid for my baby.  They of course, took a long needle and stuck it in my belly button.  It hurt worse than anything I had ever felt.  It told them it hurt and one of the little mean things put his hand over my eyes.  I must have fainted because the pain went away.  When I awoke or whatever again I saw the one in the robe talking to another one.  Their backs were turned to me so I figured what have I got to lose.  I made fun of the back of their heads and told them they looked like basket balls.  ONe said, You are making fun of us?  I said Yes.  I want to go. He said not yet.  There was much more but this is hard to talk about and I need to stop now.  There were helicopters around the ship when I first saw them before I was awakened.  I will detail this later."
"possible abductions when I was a kid living in Ct. in the middle of the night i would be forcibly floated out of house by short peoplei have a few memories of very lucid dreams or something which took place when I was quite young(between the ages of 6-10?) which at the time seemed significant even to me at that age. I remember one night being floated against my will down the stairs of our house. I was terrified , and my feet were about a foot off the ground .there was a short figure (even seemed shorte than me )which I took to be a which and it was beside me the whole time. I tried to grab the wall and the bannister but could not get a firm hold. My next memmory, can&apos;t say wether or not it was the same night, occured in my driveway. this one happened repeatedly. I would find myselfe being floated down my driveway towards the road by little grey men . that they conformed so accurately to the modern stereo-type is the reason that I am reporting these events.  thes e guys seemed very real to me. after the first time I seemed to recognise them and them me . like with the witch, my feet were about a foot,maybe two feet off the ground and I would keep trying to find the ground so i could run, with my legs moving in a cycling motion below me ,but i never found it. This hpenned about three or for times and at least one of the times one of my little sisters was there with me. At the time I thought these were morethan dreams and wondered if maybe they were real but in another dimension or something that shared the smame space that I normally lived in but was normally not accesible. I also remember finding myselfe in my next door nighboors back yard in the middle of the night and having to climb up the hill back to my house. I moved to Scotland when i was therteen and didn&apos;t have anymore of these dreams. But I did have another strange dream when I moved back to connecticut for university I was staying at a freinds house in New Canaan durring the summer when I had this dream where I was on my back on like a hospital bed , being steered through a huge well lit place by two people. there were many other people , in groups but I didn&apos;t take much mote of them.when i was left olone on the bed I tried to run but my feet had some kind of glass sandles or something crudely stuck to the soles. as I ran back the way they had brouht me these sandles slid arround on the mettalic floor.  I ended up in some kind of smaller darker room with some people who were doing a project and were very calm and made me feel more relaxed. this could have just been a dream,I really dont know ,but I mention it just in case anyone else has had a similar one I am 27 years of age and fairly well educated and work as a deck -hand in Miami by the way- about a month ago I saw a green/blue fireball looking north west from my balcony .It was bigger and slower than a shooting star and move more horizontal than virtically. it dissapeared after lees than two seconds. it was almost the sise if the moon."
"while walking on beach, two teenagers witnessed football-field-sized triangular craft over water from distance of approx. 50 feet.In August of 1985 while my family vacationed for a week in South Nags Head, NC, a friend of mine and I watched a triangular-shaped craft above us at the beach one night.  Although I do not recall precisely what week we were there, this incident took place on a Friday night.  I and my friend, both females aged 14 at the time, customarily strolled along the shoreline in the evenings.  I estimate that our &quot;sighting&quot; occurred around 8 p.m., but that time is not absolute. I recall that night as very dark, both starless and moonless.  However, it is possible that the fear I felt after we encountered the craft skewed my impressions of the environment; to be certain of the moon phase, I&apos;d have to check a calendar from back then.  I do remember absolutely that the evening began clear and temperate, with just a few stringy clouds hanging here and there over the ocean.  I was looking down, trying to avoid stepping with my bare feet on the sand crabs that come out at night.  So it was my friend who first saw something odd in the sky. &quot;Do you see those lights?&quot; she asked me.  I followed her gaze, then, and I saw five lights in a tight triangular formation...the center light was red, and it was the largest.  It was flanked on either side by two smaller white lights.  I do not remember any of the lights flashing; they all maintained a kind of focused dull sheen, if that makes sense.  They did not emit beams or illuminate the sky around them.  Together, they formed what we later interpreted as the &quot;nose&quot; of the craft, although we did not at first notice any other lights or even an outline of the craft&apos;s shape because the night was so very dark.  I am guesstimating the craft&apos;s distance from us as about 50-100 feet -- very close -- and about the same distance up in the air from the ocean, but the darkness and the lack of earthbound objects (i.e. trees) by which to judge height/size made it difficult to pinpoint how large or how close this object was. As I looked up, I caught this &quot;nose&quot; emerging seemingly out of nowhere.  In retrospect, I believe that I decided on-the-spot that the craft must have been behind cloud cover because that was the only way I could rationalize its sudden appearance.  But as I said above, what few clouds there were that night were unsubstantial and spaced far apart from one another.  As farfetched as it seems, I have to consider that the craft may actually have been &quot;cloaked&quot; in some fashion and then it revealed itself...?  I feel ridiculous writing that, but I have no other explanation.  It&apos;s possible that my friend and I just happened not to see it until it was dead even with where we stood.  But the enormity of the craft and its apparent proximity to us makes that possibility seem unlikely to me. Regardless of how the lights got there, from the moment my friend and I first noticed them, some inexplicable quality they seemed to give off made us both vaguely uneasy.  I think that strangeness was why my friend had to ask me whether or not I saw what she saw, and it was why I didn&apos;t question her needing my confirmation.  I&apos;m not sure how long it took us to realize that a big contribution to this strange &quot;vibe&quot; we were experiencing was the craft&apos;s utter silence.  It wasn&apos;t merely an absence of engine or other familiar aircraft noise; it was an intense, all-pervasive silence that was eerily powerful precisely because it was so absolute.  It was a consuming silence, the likes of which I cannot recall experiencing in any other situation. I have always remembered that silence and have tried to describe it on the few occasions that I have discussed my &quot;sighting&quot; over the years with friends.  But it wasn&apos;t until I happened to catch a bit of a cable program the other night that I heard another so-called witness state that she had viewed a completely silent airborne object.  That was the first time I had ever heard a UFO-sighting detail that matched my own experience, and it made me snap back to the events of August &apos;85.  I researched online and came across this site; now that I&apos;ve read numerous other reports, I understand that very many people indeed have witnessed silent crafts.  A few have also seen triangular crafts (another detail from my personal encounter that I had never heard elsewhere).  Obviously, I have not made a point of keeping up with ufology!  Hearing and reading some other people&apos;s testimony has encouraged me to share my experience now.  Although I have never doubted the nature of what I saw that night, the content of other witnesses&apos; reports lends credence in my mind to my personal memories, legitimizing them somehow. So I will continue with my report:  I and my friend stopped walking to watch these lights for awhile.  At some point, we became aware of a sixth light.  It was the same color and size as the large dull-red light which marked the center of the &quot;nose&quot; of the ship, and it was straight back from that light.  (Imagine an arrow, designated only by five points outlining the tip of the arrowhead and a single dot at the base of the arrow).  Here is where my friend&apos;s and my accounts differ; one of us thought that the space between the original five lights and this single sixth light encompassed about one football field&apos;s length, but the other thought it was closer to two football fields long.  After all this time, I don&apos;t recall which of us insisted on which length.  Let me reiterate how hard it was to determine size and distance in that environment. Now that we saw the sixth light (it, too, just quietly asserted itself; it may have been there all along, or it may have appeared after the others), we determined that the entire area in between must be one giant craft.  This final light marked the middle of the third leg that formed the base of the triangle.  I know that my friend and I agreed that the ship was triangular and basically flat, but as far as I remember, we couldn&apos;t actually see an outline.  It was like this ship swallowed the whole night sky above us.  I remember just barely discerning the distant horizon break between the dark blue ocean &amp; the deep black sky, and my vision was 20/20 at the time.  So if the night really was as dark as I am remembering, the craft was either pitch black itself or it was utterly transparent. We never questioned that the sixth light belonged to the same craft.  All of the lights moved in tandem.  They slid so smoothly and slowly across the sky that their motion was almost imperceptible.  They moved in the same direction in which my friend and I had been walking, and then shortly after we stopped to watch them, they stopped, too.  After I&apos;m not sure how long, we tried moving forward again, and the craft moved with us.  We stopped again; it stopped again.  I think anxiety started seeping in to me about then if it hadn&apos;t already.  Perhaps the coincided movements were an optical illusion, as when you view a painted portrait from many angles and it seems to always be looking directly at you.  But my friend and I got the very definite impression that the craft was watching us.  We reacted by speaking in low murmurs as if it could hear us, and for some reason I got it into my head that we ought not stand looking at it for too long at a stretch or it would overpower us.  I kept having to shake off a certain numbness -- not so much a physical numbness as a mental one.  It was very easy to fall into a sort of spellbound state as we watched these lights. Eventually, we decided to head back in the direction we&apos;d come from.  I think we were both beginning to feel frightened, but the onset of fear was slow.  We turned and walked back down the beach, and lo &amp; behold -- the craft switched direction, too.  It did not turn; it just moved &quot;backwards,&quot; so that the sixth light -- the second red light -- now became the &quot;front.&quot;  I remember feeling a bit scared, but more giddy.  It was like a game we were engaging in with this strange craft.  Now we stopped and waited for awhile to see what might happen.  My friend felt less anxious than I did, and I took courage from her equanimity at first. I don&apos;t know how long we stood there.  It was probably under 10 minutes, maybe even under 5 minutes, but it could have been hours.  I had absolutely no grasp of time.  I know that I got that numbness again because I realized at some point that my friend had sunk down to the sand and I hadn&apos;t even noticed.  She and I had stopped talking.  The object mesmerized us, or we allowed ourselves to believe that it did.  It continued to merely hover, stationary. After we had watched it for some time, rain began to fall, lightly at its start.  Maybe it was the rain that jolted me back to my senses or maybe I just &quot;came to&quot; again of my own accord, but whatever the reason, I forced my attention away from the lights.  I bent down to look at my friend&apos;s face.  I had to get close up to her because of the darkness, so when I looked in her eyes, we were only a few inches apart.  I remember that what I saw in her eyes sent a chill through me.  She was smiling a strange little smile and her eyes were all glazed over.  It wasn&apos;t like she was totally unresponsive or anything, but there was an unnatural excitement and faraway attitude that she conveyed.  (I should clarify here that we were both very much drug-free).  When she spoke -- something like, &quot;you&apos;re in my way, I want to see them&quot; -- her voice quality had changed, too.  It was then that I understood that what I&apos;d taken for her equanimity was actually closer to her willingly &quot;zoning out.&quot;  That really scared me.  The rain started to fall harder. Then, quite suddenly, the whole craft just took off at a speed that made my breath catch in my throat.  Again, absolutely no sound unless it was quieter than the rain.  The craft went up the beach about a half-mile at approximately a 30-degree incine, and there it stopped near a short cliff.  At first we thought it wasn&apos;t doing anything, but then we noticed that the positions of the lights relative to one another seemed to change.  That was because, as we soon figured out, the craft was turning around.  It did not bank at all -- the nose did not dip down.  The whole craft just turned on a flat plane.  Oddly, as it turned, we could see all of the lights all of the time.  It was as if the inside of the craft were invisible -- we could see the &quot;nose&quot; lights through the &quot;tail&quot; light like no craft was in between.  Yet we had no doubt that there really was a craft in the shape of a triangle, not just disconnected lights.  So I think that the ship must have been very, very flat. Another few minutes went by, during which we couldn&apos;t tell what the craft was doing.  But then we understood that, in a slow, steady, direct line, it was returning -- it was approaching our area again.  It was moving so deliberately and so directly towards us that at first we hadn&apos;t been able to perceive its motion.  Somehow, seeing those lights begin to get larger with the perspective as the craft neared again, my friend and I finally got filled to bursting with a sort of elated terror, and we ran all the way back down the beach where we&apos;d come from and then up a gravel road to our cabin.  The rain was furious now and blinding.  I am not a sportive person, but I ran fast and hard that night with no regard for my bare feet on the rough gravel.  They got fairly cut up from our run. I remember seeing other people on the beach as we ran back.  Being 14, we yelled loudly all the way home, garbled giddy warnings about &quot;the lights!  the lights!  don&apos;t let them take you!&quot; and so on.  People flitted past in a blur as we ran, but I do remember some puzzled looks on people&apos;s faces.  It occurred to me later to wonder whether they even saw these lights at all.  But when I and my friend finally got back to our empty cabin (my parents were out for the evening), we slammed &amp; locked the door and turned on all the lights and pulled down all the blinds -- and as we yanked down the blinds, we kept peering through the windows.  We couldn&apos;t see the lights where they should have been.  The whole run back had taken maybe 5 minutes and we hadn&apos;t checked behind us to see the location of the lights since maybe 2 minutes earlier when the other houses had obscured our view.  Now, gazing through a back window, we finally located the lights again.  Maybe the reason we had gotten puzzled/startled looks from people as we ran was because the craft had zoomed off, far past the area where it had made that no-bank turn earlier, and higher up.  It must have moved very quickly.  The fact that it had flown away again rather than continue to move toward where we had been standing excited us because that &quot;confirmed&quot; that the craft had actually been focusing on me and my friend.  We decided that it had wanted to abduct us and that it nearly had.  I&apos;d still like to think that.  But who knows."
"((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an artificial date and time to the case.  PD))Possible abduction from my room.I had just laid down when I heard a high pitched whirring sound.Then a extremely bright light came through my window. I can remember grabbing my bed and trying to hold on because it felt like I was being absorbed into the light. The next thing I remember I was lying on a bed or table. The feel and look of the table was cold and had a gray porcelan look to it. It did not have legs but the base came from the floor. I was covered with a thin silver blanket it did not feel as if were made from cloth. There were several beings standing beside the table I believe 2 on one side and 3 on the other. On the side with 3 one stood by my head and tried to calm me as the others performed the procedures. He seemed to communicate to me telepathically I do not remember him speaking to me directly. I&apos;m not sure of the color but they were medium hieght. With two elongated eyes and a slit for a mouth.  He informed me that I would not remember this, that I would not be harmed and they would try not to hurt me. I remember this light above my head, it started at my head and slowly and extremely painfully moved down my body. It felt like I was being rolled by a rolling pin. When it got to my feet it stopped I was in alot of pain. I remember feeling like I was going tp puke as I was being told that they were going to make one more pass back up to my head. At that point I began pleading to be let go that it was to painful I could not take it. The being at my head then said something to the being that I took to be in charge thay seemed to have a little heated arguement. He turned to me and told me that I had years earlier ask them to come and that I would not resist. Then I remembered yelling into the sky years earlier with a friend that I wanted to meet and would be willing to be examined by a UFO. Now that they were doing it he said I was whining about it. A few more words were exchanged with his boss and the light began its trip back up. The one comforting me said &quot;We are sorry if we harmed you and scared you&quot; I lost it. I remember feeling  the beam place me in my bed and as I looked up the light left my room. I was scared ((word deleted)) I ran to my parents room crying and then I went to some of the windows in the house to look outside. My parents dismissed it. A few days later on the news a UFO was reported to have been seen in a city close to where I live. I have told only a few people but we joke about it. However I am tired of joking about it because it did happen. I remember it and I have tried to avoid reading or watching anything that might embellish my abduction. I trie! d to be calm and remember as much as I could because I knew no one would believe me. I think they put me back before they had finished. I was 21 or 22 years old. Non smoker, non drinker and I did and do not use drugs."
saw two objects go from northwest southwest over ocean and san jaun islands twords bellingham with a long trailI was sitting around in my moms room playing some computer game and I looked out the window over the ocean and saw two objects proceeding in a south/south-west direction fairly slowly for the estimated distance ....four mile....with a tail that both I and my brother thought at that distance would be about one and a half miles long as I said there were two objects moving in paralel paths one etheir being higher about 4 degrees. the highest one being about 12-15 degrees above the horizon and about 20 horisontal degrees infront of the lower one...I went and told my brother and we started looking through binoculars at the objects thiking they might be planes but they more resembled shperes or mabey cigar shaped objects..with the trail covered most of the objects or made it very blurry so we just saw the ?front? of them. I have to say that I am very interested in the ufo phenomena as well as the abduction phenomena and am a possible abductee my brother however is quite the oposite being the &quot;ideal&quot; sckeptic and he belivies what we saw was not &quot;man made&quot; I am adding this so it is known for the reader peter if you wish to contact please do
"hovering light, no sound, exited at very high rate of speedFive separate individuals reported seeing a light, something like a spotlight, hovering above a ridge about 15 miles west of Lawrenceburg, TN, in an area known locally as &quot;Piney.&quot;  It made no sound whatsoever. It changed locations several times, moving at the speed that would be expected of a helicopter, hovering over several different ridges.  After between 5 and 10 minutes, it suddenly shot away at an incredible speed, impossible for an airplane.  The next day, unknown to the other witnesses, several people came into the local country store and asked if others had seen the object, describing it in exactly the same manner. This has been going on intermittenly in this area for years, but no one likes to talk about it.  There have also been numerous cattle mutilations, the most recent reported one occurring about a year or so ago.  It was reported on the radio news as a crime, describing the bowels and eyes of the cattle appearing to be cut out surgically with a knife!!!  Locals say it was just coyotes.  This is a very rural, conservative area, and most people out here would never admit to a stranger that they might have seen a UFO. Witnesses are farmers, factory workers, and laborers.  The common explanation is that it must be secret government testing of aircraft. Over the years, the lights have appeared many times, usually hovering over ridges, sometimes appearing to land and then take off.  I am not aware of anyone saying they have witnessed any aliens or having been abducted, but I will admit here that I have had marks appear on my inner elbow that look just like where I have had a blood test (i.e., needle mark).  I have never used IV drugs and I hate needles.  Also, shortly after I moved out here to the country, I began having excrutiating joint pain, for which I was tested for lyme disease. All tests were negative, and no explanation was found.  After a couple of months of this, I had a feeling (please don&apos;t think I&apos;m crazy) that something was in the skin between by left thumb and index finger.  I got a needle and dug out an object that looked something like a poppy seed, but not exactly.  I studied it but couldn&apos;t figure out what it was, so I threw it away.  I have never had those type of joint pains since that day.  I never thought much about it until the last couple of weeks when I have been reading when I have been reading about alien abductions.  I have no counscious memory of anything like that, but I do have a just-beneath-the-surface memory of &quot;something&quot; terrible and frightening happening, and I think I know when and where it happened (1975, Murfreesboro, TN).  The almost-memories are brought back by certain chemical smells (like poison) or some types of music.  I don&apos;t know what to make of any of it."
"While heading west on I-80, between Youngstown and Cleveland, we encountered something we can&apos;t explain...While heading east on I-80, between Youngstown and Cleveland, my business partner and I were heading back to Michigan after attending a comic convention. We were...well, making good time and I had looked at the clock on the dashboard and it read 10:22pm. My partner and I were discussing our trip when he said holy... you know... and I looked out the windshield. Above the cross over an over pass some distance back was a bright light with a light green outer ring. We figured it might have been an aircraft or a light on a tower, till it dropped straight down with out an arc, with increasing speed so fast that it looked like someone had taken a picture at night and moved the camera while the film was being exposed, giving it a solid line of light because it fell that fast. Then it did a 90 degree turn like it was a giant log ride and shot out at the horizon. Disappearing from sight. I looked at the clock on the dash after seeing it and it read 11:38 pm. I don&apos;t completely believe in this stuff, but after seeing that object fall and speed off, I can&apos;t think of anything it could&apos;ve been. Nothing, that I know of short of a TOW missle, can arc in a 90 degree turn at that rate of decent without tearing itself to pieces. A TOW missle would have had a fire trail, instead of a white light with green outer ring. Then there is the matter of losing our time. Abducted, I don&apos;t know and don&apos;t think such a thing can or normally occurs, but we lost almost 45 minutes of time. The driver had been checking the time to gauge the trip back throught the whole trip and to keep from getting tickets. So what was it?? And what happened to the 45 minutes??"
"Huge object. At least 2 football fields long. Altitude approx. 500 ft. Observed moving slowly westerly direct. No lights. No sound. Underlit by city lights.My sighting took place in the early seventies, in Salinas, California.  I think I was about 15 or so.  It late and I didn&apos;t feel like going to bed, so I decided to do some stargazing.  I grabbed a soda, and tossed a folding chaise lounge chair up onto the garage roof to lay back on.  After being up there for a short time, I noticed movement in the eastern sky.  It was not a moving point of light that I saw, but rather an area of stars being blocked out by a huge object moving slowly across the night sky.  At first I thought it was a blimp, but quickly dismissed this when I realized that it was much too large.  The best way to describe the object is to say that it looked much like a naval battleship turned upside down, only a little more rounded at the ends.  It displayed no lights of it&apos;s own, but I was able to observe the underside as it had become dimly lit by the city lights.  The thing that was really weird about this craft, was the fact that it moved in total silence.  At one point, it was no more than 500 feet almost directly above me. I heard nothing from it.  The object continued moving slowly in a westerly direction towards the ocean, and disappeared from sight.     I am 42 years old, married 18 years, and the father of six.  Up until now, the only people I&apos;ve told of this were my parents, my wife and kids, and my best friend.  I&apos;m not saying that I&apos;ve ever been abducted, but when I think back, there were some pretty weird things that happened to me during my childhood.  I can remember being scared in the middle of the night, and getting out of bed.  I remember looking down the darkened hallway, and seeing a small figure backlit at the end of the hall.  I remember the figure appearing startled.  I didn&apos;t recall anything after that, and dismissed it as a dream. When I awoke in the morning.  Another time, I awoke in the middle of the night to see a small hooded figure kneeling by my bed.  When I moved, the figure stood up.  It was wearing a long, hooded robe, much like what a monk would wear.  In ! the darkness, I could not see a face.  This really freaked me out, and I snatched the covers up over my head.  The next morning, I asked my parents if either of them had checked on me during the night.  They said they had not.  My mom said that maybe it was an angel, so that&apos;s what I told myself to keep sane as I grew up.  The last weird thing I&apos;d like to mention about my childhood, is a small metallic object I noticed under the skin of my outer thigh.  I say it was metallic, as it was just under the skin to the point where I could tell it was grey metal color.  I don&apos;t remember how it got there.  I remember telling my friends that it was there from getting shot with a pellet gun, and that he pellet was still there, although in fact, I was never shot.  the small &quot;thing&quot; is gone now, and there is no scar.  I&apos;ve never really put all this weird stuff together until the last 10 or 15 years.  I kind of look at it as all being pretty circumstantial.  I have, and do experience sleep paralysis from time to time.  I know what that is.  REALLY scary, but I don&apos;t remember being beamed up to a mothership or any of that stuff.  I&apos;ve lived a pretty normal, relatively uneventful life.  I&apos;ve got some baggage, like most people do, but nothing related to my sighting and the few unexplained occurrences of my childhood.  I don&apos;t think I&apos;m an abductee or anything.  If I am, I don&apos;t think I want to know the details !"
"We were watching two very bright &quot;headlights&quot; approaching us (we were on slope) and they were coming through btwn 2 tree tops.  Then it was over us &amp; a wee bit to our left. White lights in the &quot;front&quot; &amp; wings and red lights in parallel rows on the &quot;belly&quot; - nothing beyond that.  No tail! It was very very low and considering how low it was flying it was fairly quiet, it was moving somewhat slowly. It disappeared over &amp; behind the tree tops.It was near 3am on Saturday (4/17/99)morning.  My friend and I were sitting on a blanket enjoying the first warm night, stargazing, laughing, talking, and listening to music.  At the same time we both noticed 2 &quot;headlights&quot; in front of us between the tops of 2 trees.  We noticed the lights becoming larger but then not seeming to move at all.  Like they were just &quot;planted&quot; in the tree tops - then she started joking about &quot;hope they don&apos;t abduct us&quot; and I replied and so forth. Then, I don&apos;t know how, it was to our left a little and up above us so that we could see the lights on the underside.  We saw white light at the front of the aircraft, one, I believe, on each wing.  And 2 rows of red lights running down the &quot;belly&quot; and then nothing.  There appeared to be no more ship beyond that point.  No tail at all.  The object was moving fairly slow, quite low (considering that it didn&apos;t appear to be much higher than the top of a good-sized cedar or Douglas fir and considering how low this was flying, it was not noisey at all.  We watched it go behind the trees which were behind us (the property is ringed by trees all around it) and then disappear.  There was 1 object.  Shape - well, I&apos;ve been questioning if it were a stealth bomber. I guess triangle is best I can come up with.  or manta ray. could not tell the color. Brief description of the observers?  Such as? Me:  Single mother, college-educated, stable (have worked at large reputable law firm for 11 1/2 years), balanced, peaceful, Washington state resident for nearly 12 years.  I don&apos;t know what you want to know, I&apos;m sorry. Friend:  Married, mother of 2, chef, hard-worker, Washington resident for many years."
"Observed objects passing along the banks of city reservoirBack in the early 80&apos;s here in Greensboro, I and my dog were traveling home from some friends house in the country and crossed one of the bridges across our lakes north of town. I took a look down the lake to the east towards the marina some 3 miles away. I noticed two lights low in the sky which seem to be moving my direction, so I stopped and parked on the side of the road to watch. My thought was that it was an airplane heading to the airport to the west of my position. But as I watched, the two lights seperated to travel one on each side of the lake, both objects stayed at a very low altitude, possibly less than a 100 feet above the ground. This was really getting interesting. As they got within several hundred yards maybe further, the one on the right shore line moved across the lake to fall in behind the other and they passed my position one following the other, some 200 yard from me. The interesting traites where that these objects made no noise at all and as they passed, the objects stayed a ball of light no matter what angle they were to me, never did there appear to be any frame or structure to them. They may have been the size of possibly a truck tire, it is hard to figure the size and they did not have the halo glow like a street light, I don&apos;t recall them eluminating things. I watched as they passed and can&apos;t really remember how they left my vision. I had no missing time and have had no later memories of anything else happening other than the wonderful unexplainable sighting. Being a student of metaphysics, my interpertation of what I saw, was that these were energy beings checking on the state of the ecology here. Interesting to this was that a couple of weeks later, riding as a passenger in my sister&apos;s car, returning from visiting these friend again, crossing the same point, I looked out across the lake to the west and saw what appeared to be a UFO hovering and at that instance it appeared that a blue beam of light flashed from the object to the ground. Having recently read about abductions and that a lot of the people abducted stated that they were moved from the ground to the ship on a beam of blue light, I would guess an abduction may have been in process. This second encounter now adds the possible purpose of the first sighting as that maybe they were locating this abductee. I was unable to watch the second sighting unfold, being that may sister had no intention of stopping that close to what could be a UFO. I feel extemely fortunate to have had this experience as it has helped to open my mind to the fact that there is more going on around us than we can ever imagine."

"saw bright orange light making qiuck movements,followed us for approximitly five miles, intersepted car causing electrical failure in car,bright surrounding light,banging on car, wipers beating windshield,inside of car was bright,car felt like it was levitated,extreme static,cell phone and police issued radio would not work, questionable abduction????My husband and I have seen a questionable distant light in a very remote mountain area, for at least the last eight months off and on. Usually between 2:00 and 6:00 a.m. in only selected areas we frequently travel. The areas are remote wooded and recently logged areas on the west side of the mountain. About 2 months ago we had my husbands mother babysit our son.We were in the woods and called her to say we would be home in 30 minutes,at about 10 p.m. on our way out of the woods we saw the same orange light but was closer than normal, we got out of the truck to watch it in the distance moving about for what we thought was about 2 minutes.The light disappeared and we got back in the truck and headed home.When we got on the highway my husband asked what time it was and it was after 12:00.At 11:00 my mother in law called my sister in law to ask if she had seen or heard from us,and she hadn&apos;t she then called our cell phone and could not get through.We arrived at my mother in laws house at 12:30 and could not account for the lost time.Last night My mother in law was watching our son for the night we went spot-lighting bucks in the cut timber ridges where my husband has been hunting.On the way in we noticed that the wildlife behavior was very odd,they paided us no attention at all.We have been doing this in this same area for years and have never seen this behavior before such as:an owl sitting in the road and not moving when we approached it in the truck we stopped beside it and it flew into the side of the truck.Very exsessive amounts of small game like skunks,rabbits,coons,opposum,and rodents all traveling in the same direction out of the cut timber.At the same time about 3:30 a.m. we observed a female deer acting very strange as we passed by she came to the truck and looking behind her into the clear cut acting confused,we assumed a buck was pushing her towards the road so we shinned the hard wood hollow looking for the buck,not seeing him we eased down the road to give him a few minutes to come into the clear cut. We drove up the road and turned around to come back to find she was the only doe we saw which is not usual for we usually see 15-30 does a night.She was in the same spot still confused, we shined behind her! for the buck to find nothing on the first pass of the spotlight,upon the second pass of the spotlight we saw a red-eyed deer.We have never observed a red-eyed deer most deer eyes reflect green.When the hit the red-eyed deer he moved swiftly over the ridge and out of site.We waited a few more minutes to see if he would return to the doe.Afer about 5 minutes we he did not return so we down an adjacent road to see if he had circled the ridge.When shinning the back side of the same ridge on the first couple of passes of the spotlight we saw nothing driving slowly while still shinning the spotlight we spotted the red-eyed deer.My husband looked through the scope of the gun to see if it was a buck.It was about 200yds. off the road it was very hard to locate the deer in the cut timber.When my husband got a good look at it,it had a enormously massive rack not usually found in this region.He got out of the truck and fired one shot at the deer and I saw another red-eyed deer to the left of the first.He shot the red-eyed buck it dropped to the ground. He looked at the one on the left through his scope and it was also a massive buck. He shot at it also and it too dropped to the ground but was trying to get up so he fired a second shot then it was also lifeless.We sat in the truck for 45 minutes because my husband felt somthing wasn&apos;t right we shinned the spotlight on the deer 3 different times to see if the deer were still laying there.My husband still could not concieve the idea of the two abnormally large deer.After the third time checking they were still there,we decided to turn the truck around we came back to retrieve the bucks.We were about to get out of the truck, when my husband turned to get his gun and out of the back window he saw the same mysterious orange light in a distance moving very rapidly in figure eights and looping in the sky.My husband said there&apos;s your light.I turned to see the light moving while he cranked the truck because of unusual movement of the light.Scarred to death he floored the truck while! I watch ed the light,half way to the road it started coming towards us very rapidly.I screamed go It&apos;s coming after us.My husband driving as fast as possible while I was still looking at it coming My husband let out an ungodly scream and bowed out of the seat he felt an electrical serge in his back and was screaming everything was black and white.A few feet from the road I turned to see that the light had stopped where he had shot the red-eyed bucks.We keept going towards the main highway as fast as we could and scarred to death.As I looked to the left once we were on the highway the light  had followed us, traveling 100ft. above tree level never leaving our side approximatly a mile away. Panicing trying to get away from it we were going about 90mph.But even through the curves it never left our side for about 5 miles.About 3/4 of a mile before approaching a steep ridge the highway went over, it started angling towards us appearing to intercept us at the base of the ridge.Pushing the truck as fast as it would go,screaming and crying more terrified than we have ever been. At the base of the ridge it was directly above us we felt enormous static electricity we heard a loud bang on the truck like someone had thrown a baseball at it.My husband screamed radio the police as I turned the police issued radio which will radio to Sequathcie, Grundy, Marion, and Bledsoe Counties as I keyed it made a popping sound and went dead.  At the same time the electrical systems in the truck began to fail.  The truck headlights, interior lights, gages, electric fuel pump, and engine began to fail which caused the truck to start missing.  I saw the windshield wipers beating on the windshield and there was a bright glowing light inside the truck.  Suddenly a calmness fell over us and I held both of my husband&apos;s hands as we starred at each other confused and terrified at the same time the truck felt as though it was being levitated less than a foot off the road at the same instance my husband grabbed the steering wheel as the truck was s! till mis sing we were coming out of the light now much slower than what we entered about a 1/4 of a mile back.  As soon as we left the light the truck began to function normally again.  Still terrifed and panicking we drove about 3/4 of a mile as fast as the truck would go to our friend&apos;s house for help.  As we turned into our friend&apos;s road I looked back and and saw that the light had dissappered.  As we skidded into our friend&apos;s driveway we jumped out of the truck and ran to the front door.  As my husband was beating on the door he noticed that all the lights were on, all the vehicles were there and that his Friend&apos;s two house dogs did not come to the door barking like they always have.  Terrified he beat on the door harder and began to scream to be let in.  Panicking he reached to where his friend always kept his spare house key and it wasn&apos;t there.  He tried the door knob and it was unlocked.  He ran into there house screaming his friend&apos;s name and yelling for help.  Although four adults and two loud house dogs live in the house there was total silence.  He ran to his truck and grabbed the cell phone and tried to call his frien&apos;s number hoping he would answer but it would not go through.  Immediatly he called his sister&apos;s home for her to pick us up because we were extremly disoriented.  His sister answered and he began to scream hurry come out here and get us out of here theyr&apos;e after us.  the phone kept cutting in and out but he finally got her to understand where he was at.  His sister and her roommate called us back from her roommate&apos;s cell phone as they were franticly coming up the mountain not knowing what was going on they had called back to let us know they were coming as fast as they could and trying to find out what was going on, but when he tried to warn them to watch out for the orange light the phone died.  He tried calling back several times but it would not go through.  About six minutes after he had called them they slid into the yard expecting the worst.  We ran screaming and jumped into the ba! ck seat of his sister&apos;s car.  She could tell how mortfied we were and immeditly back out of the yard and hauled ass back towards the highway to take us home.  We were so shook up that we were babbling and could not get them to understand what had happened.  As we pulled onto the highway my husband yelled &quot;There it is!!!!&quot; as he pointed at the bright light in the sky that was now white. His sister and her roommate(who is an EMT) both saw the light following the car a great distance up in the sky.  His sister who had heard us talking about the orange lights before knew immedialy what had happened to us.  She began to drive over 100 mph to get to the only convience store that was open at this hour approxmalty 4:45 a.m.  We pulled into the parking lot and parked in front of the doors.  We sat there for about 20 minutes trying to explain what had happened the whole time all four of us were watching the light that followed us.  It moved side to side, up and down, and it would fluctuate between bright and dim, always returning to bright.  then we decided to go to our house which is about a mile from the store the white light followed us at the same distance since we had been with them.We pulled into the driveway and sat in the car the light was still at the same distance in front of us and I turned around looked out the back window and saw an identical light as in front of us approaching us from behind but keeping the same amount of distance as of the one infront of us.We decided the best place to be was a public area so we went back to the store we sat there for about another 10 minutes and decided to go back off the mountain to his sister&apos;s and stay.But my husband was begging us not to go back towards where the incident had occured.We got about 4 miles from the store which was about a mile and a half where the light was over the truck.When his sister&apos;s roomate who was watching the light all the way from the store which up until this point had remained the same distance,started to scream &quot;turn around it&apos;s coming @#$%!! !!!&quot; we made a u turn and the light shot back up to where it had been the whole time. we went back to the store and sat for about 5 minutes and his sister and her roomate were now terrified of the situation also.We drove back to our house again and no one would get out of the car because the light was still following us.We finally decided to brave it and go to his sister&apos;s house as fast as her car would possibly go.Once we hit the road we never slowed down but the light traveled the same distance beside the car as it had been.as we drove down the mountain it stayed above the mountain but still beside us and always in view.When we got to their house which is at the base of the mountain it was still above the mountain but in plain view over the valley, we went into the house about 5 minutes later his sister went out to her car and said that the light was gone.we stayed there and colmed down and tried to figure out what had happpened. we couldn&apos;t figure any other reason of them chasing us other than the red-eyed deer. so we waited until daylight and went back to the clear cut to see if the deer were still there because we couldn&apos;t understand the relationship between the red-eyed deer and the orange light chasing us or if there was any at all. We needed to see the deer to prove to ourselves that there was no connection.When we got to where the red-eyed deers were laying we saw nothing from the road.But my husband knew exactly where they were laying so his sister,my husband, and I walked into the clear cut to where we had seen them laying.But we found nothing no hair no blood and no tracks as if they were never there.We spread out and searched for deer tracks and walked for 2 hours over a 15 acre area and found no tracks that were equivilant to the massive deer we saw.As we were walking we found a deer carcuse not visible from the road which was laying on it&apos;s back without any meat, flesh,hair,or blood anywhere around it but suspiciously ALL bones were still intact. we left the clear cut and are now wondering what ha! ppens ne xt?"
"This was an object that could hover stationary and then accelerate to 2,000 mph or possibly much higher... it would move instantaneously with a blur of speed to a point 30&ordm; to 90&ordm; across the night shy. I lived on air bases all my life- please read the following information. I have sent this stuff the Art Bell... this WAS REAL. It was NOT FROM THIS WORLD !!!Dear Whitley, (I also sent this to Art.) I am in a most unique position. I have been observing the night sky since 1983 from a snowcat in the high Sierras. Where I am, from midnight to morning, there is no light pollution. I have seen some extraordinary night- sky natural phenomena that were quite spectacular- I would love to tell you about them. I once saw a Macy&rsquo;s- sized chunk of ice light up the entireTahoe basin a cobalt blue as bright as day&hellip; it must have been as big as an iceberg&hellip; skipped across the upper atmosphere in a swath of cobalt- blue light spewing green and gold sparks. Rock and metal, I imagine&hellip; the ionizing H2O lit the night sky like a magnesium flare.  I was perched on a crag of rock at the top of Echo Summit kicking back in my Bombardier snowcat at the top of Sierra At Tahoe ski area taking a break and watching the comet two years ago&hellip; when this GIANT meteorite- if you could call it that, it had to be almost all ice-gouged it&rsquo;s way sluggishly across the top of the atmosphere&hellip; Though spectacularly beautiful, such sights do not make the spine tingle and the skin crawl, the hair stand on end..&hellip;but I saw something that did one night, and that story follows&hellip; Please read this letter. I think you will find it interesting- I love Dreamland- I am fascinated by the people who call in who have seen UFO&rsquo;s- because I had an amazing encounter with one, and so did my father, who was a United Airlines pilot for thirty years. I never DREAMED I would have such an experience. My God, when it happens to YOU it changes the way you look at the night sky FOREVER. As you will read, the craft I saw could not even be from our corner of this solar system, as it defied the local constants of physics completely. Here are my stories. Absolutely true. They read like installment- articles because they were posts I made to a together-list on the net. If you think it would be of interest to your listeners, I would enjoy talking to you on the air about my years in cats at night in the high Sierra. I am articulate and though this is not the same, perhaps, as being an abductee, still, my range of night sky observations make for interesting listening. Call me if you&rsquo;d like to talk about it. I enjoy relating the stories. In January of 1992 I was sitting in my Bombardier snowcat on a run at Sierra at Tahoe, Echo Summit, Hwy. 50, South Lake Tahoe. It was around 3AM, I was making snow on Broadway. I was rested, had NOT been drinking or taking any kind of mind- altering substances !!! I am NOT a recreational drug user! I was facing to the east... the night sky was very dark and clear, with almost no light coming up from the Tahoe Basin, which was about ten miles to the east. I saw an oddly bright orange ball of fire coming up in the direction of the basin...it had unusual detail in the corona, kind of a flickering. I thought about it and decided I was looking at the exhaust of a large jet taking off out of Tahoe airport and flying directly away from me... thus the orange ball of fire. It did occur to me as odd, because large jets had ceased regular service to Tahoe several months earlier. It was raising up quite quickly...then it abruptly- and by abruptly, I mean instantaneously! took off north at a speed that made it a streak of bright orange fire. Then it stopped of a dime, hovered motionless for a second, then proceeded to do a number of these maneuvers over the next sixty seconds. I got the major willies. I was not scared, but I knew that nothing any human could build in THIS age could withstand those kind of forces- OR accelerate with the speed of the USS Enterprise going into Warpdrive. I jumped out of my cat almost instantly, looking all around to see if there were any other sources of light that could have caused a reflection on the inside of my windshield- but there weren&apos;t, and there it was, still making the same movements. I would guess from the detail and from the fact that it was to my side of a couple of peaks in the far off distance that it was three to five miles away... Then it shot straight down out of sight- and reappeared a few seconds later, shot up to about 5,000 feet above me- hovered for a minute, then instantly rose at a speed beyond anything previous, shooting straight up into the sky on a pillar o! f orange light that looked like a neon tube, and kept going, right on out of the atmosphere. I could see it for a long time, it was visible all the way out of the atmosphere. I had tried to call another cat operator to check it out but he was out of his cat at the time and busy with the snowgun he was running and did not look up. However, I was to learn this last year that I am not the only one in the Tahoe basin to see this type of craft. During my sighting of this orange fiery object, the manuevers it performed  gave me the willies- I was not fearful, the thing was a long way off- but it was covering a lot of miles on it&apos;s one-second trajectories. It moved across the night sky approximately 40 to 60 degrees...left to right, right to left, with huge altitude changes, and some of it&apos;s movements were shorter and more nearly vertical. I could not think of any possible reason for these weird manuevers. It was moving so fast that there was no real appreciable acceleration or deceleration... it was stationary, then there was a streak of orange light, then it was stationary somewhere else for a moment. I was very happy and excited to witness this. I always wondered if maybe I would see some strange phenomenon in the sky, being up in a cat on the top of the Sierra where visibility is so good, but never thought I would see anything so clearly impossible by present human technological standards... and never before or since have I seen anything so wild.. Four months after the UFO sighting in 1992, I went to a local pizza parlor where a friend was putting on the showing of a Christic Institute film called &quot;the secret war&quot;, narrated by Elizabeth Montgomery (see it if you ever have the chance- it&apos;s about the Iran Contra affair) and at the show was a very odd, spooky looking guy who said nothing until everyone was on the verge of leaving, then asked if he could have a moment to speak to everyone. He admitted that he was not there for the movie, but rather, wanted to know if anyone present had seen any ufo&apos;s in the Tahoe Basin... I thought about that for a moment and went over and said, yes, I had. He then asked me if it had been coming from the direction of the lake. I said it seemed to be...HE THEN ASKED ME IF IT WAS AN ORANGE BALL OF LIGHT. I said, yes.... WAS IT MAKING JERKY MOVEMENTS. I got the willies all over again! I looked more closely at this guy... tall, thin, gaunt, wild- eyed, looked like he had been maybe had a real bad fright he never got over&hellip; Spooky... I asked him, how the HELL did you know WHAT I SAW? He said,that&apos;s what EVERYBODY&apos;S BEEN SEEING. Turns out he had seen one like mine a couple of years earlier and had been so affected by it that he had been traveling around the Lake Tahoe Basin asking people about sightings, and he had come up with a bunch of people who had all observed similar craft- coming out of the lake or from near the lake, orange- white balls of fire, jerky, high- acceleration movement and eventual flight straight up. He asked me if I wanted to know why they made the jerky movements. He said he had talked to people from Nevada who &ldquo;knew about these things&rdquo;... said the air force &amp; CIA had learned from the Roswell craft that the controls in these things were bioelectronic, that the beings set their hands into little recesses in the seats and interfaced their own nervous systems into the craft&apos;s guidance systems, which were part-biological, and that focussed microwave beams could disrupt and disable the craft- and that the ! operator s did these maneuvers in order to avoid being shot down! Well, I don&apos;t know if I believe that. for one thing, why couldn&apos;t they just go blazing straight out of the atmosphere at a zillion knots, that should be sufficient to avoid being shot down. But I do know this- I know what I saw that night, and it was not of this planet. No human- OR human machine- could take such forces without becoming pate&rsquo;... and no structure running under the known physical constants of our little part of the universe could suffer such G forces without turning into little pieces of scrap metal. It seems to me that these things carry around with them the local constants of some other part of the universe. In fact, I have a friend who works for the air force at Edwards who wires obsolete fighters to be used as drones to be shot down by pilots in gunnery school who told me about the Aurora project... 9G&apos;s, but pilotless... flies on some kind of propane pulse engine... it&apos;s what they&apos;ve been seeing and hearing in LA, the things that leave the smoke rings up high in the sky... and that is a primitive and slow craft compared to what I saw that night. This last winter, I started at Sierra and had been working for a few weeks...while in the cat barn, I heard a couple of snowmakers talking...one of them said, &quot;Keep your eyes out for those &quot;UFO&apos;S&quot; Chuck, the security guard, has been seeing! Yeah, said he saw some BIG ORANGE BALLOF FIRE MAKING JERKY MOTIONS IN THE SKY...Ha Ha Ha Ha!!!!&rdquo; I turned around and said, WHAT DID YOU SAY!!! WHO saw this! They told me and I tracked him down... a retired man who works at Sierra as a security guard... turned out he and his wife were on the deck of their house last summer off of North Upper Truckee Road, looking south toward Meiss Meadow... which puts their sighting about the same place MINE was, - TRIANGULATION tells us more accurately where the things seem to be coming from- and he described the EXACT SAME THING I SAW. IDENTICAL. He was worried about me telling people, he didn&apos;t want people at Sierra to know, he was afraid they&apos;d think him crazy. What I have related here is all true. SOMEthing IS going on !!! I can&apos;t BELIEVE we humans fly around in machines that can do what I saw that night. I DON&apos;T think that it&apos;s US. It&apos;s THEM. Whoever they are...I just hope- they&apos;re friendly. &ldquo;My father was a pilot for United Airlines for 29 years... once he returned home with a wild story about seeing a UFO... and here it is. My father is a very humorless and pragmatic individual who never had much interest in gags or jokes... so I was interested to hear his tale of seeing a UFO once in 1970...I was fourteen... he came back from a flight and told me this story... &quot;We were enroute from Chicago to LaGuardia when ground control advised us to be on the lookout for a large object that was on their radar and had been observed by several airliners in the area...as we got closer to the object we picked it up on our screen... we had a United VicePresident aboard, a captain, co- pilot,(my dad) second officer(engineer) and four stewardesses...all of whom saw the object-There were two other airliners watching the thing when we got visual on It. It had been doing high- speed erratic manuevers but was stationary when we got it on radar... then it started pacing us, staying several miles ahead and to the right...then ground control asks us, is it still there? It just went off of our screen! Right out of the MIDDLE of the screen...We had it in visual contact, as did another aircraft, but it just blinked off of everyone&apos;s radar, one by one...we were most interested in it at that point...then it shot across our flight path to our port side, and it was so fast you almost couldn&apos;t see it, just a blur...then it paced us for a while on our port side...it was a large sphere,maybe a hundred feet across or bigger...it had a green light on top and a red light on the bottom, both lights alternately tracing a path around the perimeter of the body of the craft, the green doing a half-circle across the top, left to right, the red doing an arc across the bottom half, right to left...then it shot at us at perhaps 2000- 3000 miles per hour, passing under us to our left perhaps several hundred yards below us. The shock wave rattled the airplane violently, as if we had hit a huge air pocket...&quot; About a week after my father came home with this story, a letter marked &apos;confidential&apos; came in the mail from the air force. My father was out of town on a flight. I was very curious to know if it had anything to do with his sighting. I opened it. (I knew he wouldn&apos;t care) It requested my father to attend a meeting in Manhattan in a week to discuss the sighting and it specified that he was not allowed to discuss the sighting with ANYONE, including family. This confirmed to me that he had seen what he said he did.Then, the capper: in 1993, I was watching a special, a Sixty-Minutes sort of thing on UFO&apos;s, and there was one segment that went as follows: in 1970, two airforce fighter pilots were scrambled over Norad in the Rockies to check out a large UFO which was in Norad airspace and not responding to identification requests. Both of these pilots, since retired, were able to get fairly close to the thing before it took off at a zillion miles an hour...they said, (and it was another of those getting- the- willies- moments) it was a large sphere with a green and red light, both moving in a semicircle around it, alternating left to right. They saw exactly what my father saw, same year, same continent, just 1800 miles away... This was the story he told us, my mom and me. I was very surprised and as it was extremely out of character for him to make up a story like this, I believed he had seen SOMEthing...."
"AN EVENT THAT WOULD MAKE ME A BELEIVERIT WAS AROUND SUMMER TIME. I WAS 16 AT THE TIME AND A NON-BELEIVER OF THE UFO PHENOMONEN. I CAME UP FROM SACRAMENTO AND I WAS VISITING MY PARENTS FOR THE WEEKEND. WELL IT WAS EITHER FRI,SAT,OR SUNDAY. I WAS WALKING UP NELSON ROAD HEADING TOWARDS MADRONE ST. BUT I DID&apos;NT GET THERE JUST YET. I HAD STOPPED BETWEEN TWO BUILDINGS. ONE WAS A CHURCH AND THE OTHER WAS THE SIDE OF A MINI MART. IT WAS NIGHT TIME AND I FIGURED THAT I WOULD GO FOR A STROLL IN THE TOWN GETTING TO KNOW IT BEFORE I MOVED HERE. WELL I NOTICED HOW QUIET IT GOT. THERE WERE NO CARS AROUND WICH IS TYPICAL IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN.  BUT THE ODD THING WAS NOT THAT. IT WAS THE FACT THAT I FELT MY HAIR RISE LIKE THERE WAS STATIC ENERGY OR SOMETHING. NOT ONLY THAT IN A YARD NEXT TO THE CHURCH WAS A DOG. THIS DOG JUST STARTED GOING BERSERK. IT WAS WHINING AND BARKING. WELL STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD I LOOKED AT THE DOG FIGURING IT WAS BARKING AT ME AND THEN THATS WHEN IT HIT ME. THE DOG WAS LOOKING UPWARDS TOWARDS THE SKY AT SOME TREES IN MY DIRECTION. AT THAT TIME I DID&apos;NT KNOW WHAT TO THINK. I LOOKED AROUND FIRST TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANYBODY BEHIND ME OR STANDING AROUND. BUT THERE WAS&apos;NT. SO I LOOKED BACK AT THE DOG AND THE DOG WAS RUNNING AROUND AND STARING AT THE TREE THAT WAS IN FRONT OF ME. SO I FIGURED I TAKE A LOOK AT THE TREES TO SEE IF THERE WAS A CAT OR RACOON UP THERE. THEN RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES I KIND OF PANICKED AND MY HEART WAS THROBBING. RIGHT ABOVE THE TREES WERE TWO OBJECTS. THEY WERE THE SIZE OF CARS AND THEY WERE GLOWING WHITE. THE TWO OBJECTS WERE HOVERING THERE MOTIONLESSLY AND AT TIMES MOVED AROUND JUST A LITTLE BIT.  THE OBJECTS WERE AT LEAST SIX TO TEN FEET ABOVE THE TREES. FOR SOME ODD REASON IN MY MIND I HAD A FEELING THAT THEY WERE WATCHING ME AND IN SOME WAY IT WAS TRUE. THEY WERE. SO RECALLING SOME STORIES I HEARD I TURNED AROUND AND STARTED RUNNING BECAUSE I HEARD ABOUT ABDUCTIONS IN THE PAST. BUT THEN I STOPPED AND I WALKED TOWARDS THE OBJECTS AND STARED REALLY GOOD AT THEM. I TOOK OFF MY GLASSES JUST TO SEE! IF I WA S SEEING A REFLECTION OF LIGHT BUT THEY WERE STILL THERE. THESE OBJECTS WERE FANTASTIC. I HAD A FEELING THAT THEY KNEW I KNEW I WAS WATCHING THEM AS THEY WERE WATCHING ME. NOW I TURNED MY ATTENTION AT THE DOG AND THE DOG LOOKED AT ME AND WHINED AND LOOKED BACK UP AT THE OBJECTS. I LOOKED AT THE OBJECTS AGAIN AND THEN THE OBJECTS MOVED UP  HIGHER FROM THE TREE TOPS SLOWLY. THEN THEY PAUSED AND THIS IS WHAT REALLY HAD ME RUNNING HOME. THE OBJECTS SHIFTED AND MOVED IN A DIAGONAL MOVEMENT TOWARDS SPACE. THEN THEY PICKED UP SPEED AND THEN QUICKLY SHOT UP TOWARDS SPACE AND I COULD SEE THEM AS THEY GOT HIGHER AND SMALLER LOOKING. THEN WHEN THE OBJECTS GOT SO SMALL LOOKING I SEEN THE TWO OBJECTS FLASH AND DISAPEAR. I THEN RAN HOME AND TOLD MY FAMILY ABOUT WHAT JUST HAD HAPPENED. NOW WHAT AMAZED ME WAS WHEN I TOLD MY FAMILY ABOUT IT AND ON THE TELEVISION WAS A SHOW CALLED SIGHTINGS AND I HAD AN UTTER LOOK ON MY FACE. I AM NOW A BELEIVER AND NOT A SKEPTIC. I DID FAIL TO REPORT ABOUT IT SOON TO THE LOCAL SHERIFFS OFFICE DUE TO THE FACT THAT I WAS AFRAID I WOULD BE LOCKED UP FOR BEING CRAZY. NOW THERE IS TWO MORE EVENTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO ME IN THIS TOWN CALLED SUTTER WHICH I WILL HAVE TO REPORT ABOUT NEXT TIME. BUT JUST TO LET YOU KNOW ONE OF THE EVENTS HAD TO DO WITH ME WALING IN THE BUTTES AT NIGHT AND A BLACK HELICOPTER APROACHED ME. WELL I GOT TO GO FOR NOW. STAY TUNED FOR MY NEXT REPORTS NOW THAT I FEAL COMFORTABLE AND SAFE TO TALK ABOUT IT. I WILL ALSO HAVE PICTURES OF THE AREAS. GOOD BYE!"
"Was observing thru telescope for casual astronomy. Looked up in the sky to find a target star in Ursa Major when I saw due East at around 1,000 feet a sauces shaped object hovering abnd bobbing gracefully in the sky.I am an Amateur Astronomer and on Saturday night 5/29/00 (sic),  it was the first clear night in a while over the New York area. I was trying out my new 150mm refactor telescope and I was searching for star clusters near Ursa Major. I started to set up the scope at 9 P.M., and I aligned the scope to Polaris, and was setting up the tripod for 1/2 hour at the most. I decided to search for M13 in Hercules, but it was straight overhead at R.A 16hours, and I decided not to bother since the scope would be inproperly positioned for a decent view. (Too low to the ground on a small tripod.) The time was approximately 9:30 P.M. I then decided to search for M51 in Canes Venitaci when the neighbor turned on the garage light and I waited for the light to turn off. I went into the house at this time to get a cup of coffee and proceeded to got back out to the yard after the garage light went out. I started to view in the scope at a 45 degree angle due East. After searching around a bit I saw a white rotating streak in the field of view which was spiraling but figured it was a meteor falling to Earth. No problem, a typical event to see as an Amateur astronomer. After that I pointed the scope at the Star, I believe it was Altair or Arcturus. Not sure cause I didn&apos;t have the map with me. Anyway, I decided to focus the scope on the Star to see how much cromatic distortion the scope had. After all that, I decided to stop viewing. When I got off my chair and stood up, I looked at the sky for incoming clouds and saw some coming from the West. When I turned around to the East, I saw an object, rather large hovering and moving East. The object looked disc like but it was a dark shaded craft, black/dark gray. It had 4 lights, 2 red horizontal lights pointing North/South, and the other 2 lights were green pointed East / West (toward me). The lights were mounted at exact opposites to each other. The object was rather low, around 1,000 feet and was the size of a plane. The lights did NOT blink, and the craft or object made absolutely N! O NOISE. The object was hovering but moving slowly toward the East in a bobbing up and down fashion. There were 2 slow bobbing actions while it was in  my view. It did that twice, while moving East and then it slowly moved East to the horizon and over the neighbors tree and out of my viewing sight. This sighting occurred at the 10:30 P.M. time frame. I saw it for around 10-15 seconds. I immediately went into the house to tell my relative (mother) what I had saw. The time was checked at 10:34 P.M. I was not abducted cause I had a strict account of the time. I started setting up the scope at 9:00 P.M. and I was out there for around 1.5 hours. I did not wear a watch. I used the kitchen clock for all time references. Though I live near an airport, all the planes move from South to North, and North to South always. There was never a plane moving in the West to East direction here and I &apos;ve been living here since 1969. The only aircraft were helicopters, but they make lots of noise when they come over here. THe object seemed to have appeared suddenly cause I didn&apos;t notice it come over my head from the West.((NUFORC Note:  The witness has indicated that the event occurred on 29MY00.  We believe he intended to indicate Saturday, April 29, 2000.  We have taken the liberty of amending the date, predicated on our assumption.  PD))"
"After witnessing a ufo, with my family, I beleive that my mother and myself were abducted the next night.II  was the first to notice the  dim orange light in the back feilf behind our house. I noticed it thru the bathroom window. The light was bright but dim all at once....The disk seemed to just float in space at about 100 feet from the ground. It that point I yelled at my father to come over and look at the light. Mysister  was also there. Then my father went outside to get a closer look... He rushed in and called the local police...The police officers came over.They preceeded to take pictures of the craft. From that point on I cannot remeber much from this encounter. But not long after this, the neighbour had a barn about 500 yards from my parents house. One nite we awoke to this loud rucuss coming from the barn, you could hear the cows going crazy...making such a loud noise...something quite unnatural . That same nite, i remember this experience in every minute details....I awoke later that night, i cried out to my father to get me a glass of water....he got up and i followed him into the kitchen.As we are walking down the hall I could smell an odd smell; you could smell something like smoke and mildew but with a sweetness to it. Asmell i&apos;ve yet to ever experience again. So  my father was about ten feet ahead of me,  I was walking behind him, when i got to the edge of the hall I noticed soemthing behind me....A small figure about 4 feet high a grayish, greensich color with no visible eyes, ears mouth, or nose. I t had some sort of bag that it threw over me.. The last thing I remeber is the look on my fathers face. He could not move, he was frozen in mid movement, but the look on his face was shear terror. Then after wards I remember waking up. Nothing strange,nothing different. I only seemed to remeber this event about ten years ago...nothing traumatic or special happened at that time in my life. i just remembered. After I told my parent about this story, my father thaught i was going insane.....but my mother seemed to beleive me. After wards she took me aside, and admitted to me that she has seen the craft that nite, in the back feild. She remebers seeing it lanf and seeing people come out of the craft. She does not remember that much about the event. But she distinctivley remebers the event happenning on the same nite ."
"I cannot swear this was a UFO, but would like to compare our &quot;sighting&quot; with others to see what they think.This happened a long time ago. Mary Tyler Moore (NOT a re-run) was on TV at the time. It was just past dark, probably in early summer. I think the show &quot;Canon&quot; was coming on. These were my favorite TV shows at the time. I lived with my grandparents at the time, and was probably about 18 or 19 years old. I&apos;m 45 now. This would have been about 1975, I guess. My grandma, grandpa, and I were home. Grandpa has passed away now, and Grandma had a severe stroke, so I am the only one who can tell about this incident. We lived in the country, 7 miles from town, so the window curtains were up (we never closed them at night.) The weather was clear and warm. It should be noted that some very high voltage electric lines run across our farm. (We have experienced several strange phenomena besides what I describe here.) I also want to note that we frequently walked around outside the house at night, to feed animals, get things from the car, bring in clothes off the clothes line, and so forth. On really nice nights, we sometimes sat in chairs on the porch and watched the stars. So we were all familiar with the ordinary things you see at night, from our farm. For example, you can see the lights from houses of distant neighbors, and even lights that are probably part of a nearby town. But what we saw on this night was very different. I had my back to the window while watching TV. Grandpa sat across from me, facing me, and grandma was probably in the kitchen. Just then, a bright flash of light appeared outside. It was so bright that I saw it despite having my back to the window. My cousin later told us that she too had seen a bright flash of light outside from my Aunt&apos;s house, which is about a mile away. None of us ever thought this was lightening, and there was no thunder -- no sound at all. Grandpa got up and went outside. He thought something on our electrical pole had shorted out. We had been having problems with it for a few days. Grandpa came running back in, looking terrified. &quot;Strange lights, strange lights!&quot; He screamed. I had never before nor after seen Grandpa acting like this. He was one of the quietest and most calm people you&apos;ve ever known. Grandma and I ran outside. In the distance, maybe a quarter mile away, were the lights. There were several rows of red lights, stacked one on top of the other. These appeared to be in a field, about two farms distant from us. They were not in the sky; i.e., this was not a flying object but something on the ground. If I have to describe an overall shape, I would say a cigar, because the &quot;object,&quot; if it was one, was much longer than it was tall, from our point of view. If this was an object, it would have to be very large. I would say as much as 40 or 50 feet across. To me it looked as if all the many lights were distinctly separate from one another, in about 3 or 4 rows. A row across the bottom, then another row above, then another above, like well-spaced Christmas tree lights. They appeared to flicker, twinkle, or possibly rotate -- we were far enough away that I couldn&apos;t tell for sure. I know that if you stare long enough at a distant light on a dark night, it can appear to twinkle. We watched this thing for a long time, all expressing our views on what it was. Grandma thought a bunch of people had parked their cars, leaving the taillights on. Neither Grandpa nor I thought that was possible. After all, we were way out in the country and that would mean about 30 or 40 cars, all facing the same way, had somehow gained access to the neighbor&apos;s private property and left their lights on. We speculated that it might be something on fire, but the lights seemed too evenly spaced for that. In retrospect, it seems weird that none of us thought of calling the Sheriff or anything. I think it was just too bizarre and we were in too small a town and didn&apos;t want to be in the news or get laughed at. There had been a recent incident of a light following two girls home, and 16 people witnessed the light. This made the local newspaper. Also, there was a &quot;cattle mutilation&quot; in the next town, which also made the news. My grandparents really didn&apos;t want to be in the news, I think. But this does show a recent record of strange occurrances. Grandma and Granpa wanted to get in the truck, drive down the road in that direction, and see what this thing was. I myself had read a lot of UFO abduction stories in paperbacks of the time, and I was very frightened to get any closer. I really was a fraidy cat at the time, and I actually pulled them out of the truck and wouldn&apos;t let them go. I deeply regret that now, no matter what had happened. So we continued to watch this thing, and then suddenly it just disappeared. Like all the lights had turned off. Throughout this incident, we never heard a noise of any kind. We continued to look over there a while, then gave up and went into the house. ------- I want to add another, totally different incident here. We&apos;ve had a history of seeing &quot;strange lights&quot; on the farm, dating back to the turn of the century. My grandpa grew up there, and he and his brothers used to jump on mules to chase lights that appeared and disappeared in various places.  I heard these stories all my life, but had never witnessed this for myself. In 1984, I saw these lights for myself, along with my brother, sister-in-law, and mother. My brother, sister-in-law, and I were outside at night. Grandpa was having surgery and the family had all gathered. We were outside that night looking at the stars and talking. There were two australian shepherd dogs on the farm, and they suddently went racing off into the nearby pasture, which belongs to a neighbor. Thinking they were chasing the neighbor&apos;s cows, I walked over to call them back. I heard a noise like a crying baby. This is also the sound a rabbit makes when it dies. So I stood by the fence, thinking I was hearing a rabbit&apos;s death cry. (Let me note that those two dogs were NOT hunting dogs and I had never known them to hurt other animals, so this seemed strange to me.) Anyway, the dogs suddently came charging back towards me, through the fence, and got behind me. I no longer could hear the strange sound. I looked over the fence thinking maybe the neighbor&apos;s bull was chasing the dogs back toward me. What I saw was a red light, which rotated slowly. It illuminated everything in its path as it turned -- the trees, grass, etc. were all very clear. It seemed to hover a few feet above the ground, and I could not see anything supporting the light, holding the light, etc. This light was only about 50 feet or so from where I was standing, and though I could see everything the light illuminated, I saw nothing supporting the light itself. The other weird thing was that the dogs were not barking. These were very, extremely aggressive dogs when it came to strangers. One of these dogs had bit several people. The other dog had such a fierce bark that most people were afraid to get out of their cars until you called the dog off. But neither dog was barking or growling. I went to get my brother and sister-in-law and they came over to see this light. We were standing there talking about what it might be, when it went out. We started to walk back toward the house when the light re-appeared, only now it was farther away, down by the barn. At this point, my sister-in-law must have run to get my mother. I walked down towards the barn to get a closer look at this light, when it disappeared again. Very quickly, it re-appeared much further away, way out in the neighbor&apos;s field, this time at least 100 to 200 yards from the barn area where we had just seen it. I was so busy watching this light that I didn&apos;t realize my mother also saw it, until we discussed it later. Finally, the light disappeared and did not return. We never figured out what could have caused this light. Later, when Grandpa got out of the hospital, we told him about it. He just laughed, shook his head, and said, &quot;Oh. They&apos;re back.&quot;"
"at first there were window size lights, then a round lighted object, then the round object by itself that shot from ground level to theI made a repoprt of this two times during the following two weeks after the sighting by I and My (school teacher) wife. We have never had any further communication with the ufocenter or Mufon or anyone. Yet we found this event so &quot;out of this world&quot;. I cannot imagine (other than reporting an abduction) any sighting so real. Is it normal to jsut go on with life. We cannot just treat it like seeing a beautiful landscape. We discuss it with each other constantly. Was  our report too outrageous to be bellieved by the center???  ((names deleted))"
"((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))Strange beam and apparition terrifies childI didn&apos;t think anything of it until years later. I was twelve or thirteen (26 now) and my sister was eight or nine (22 now). My mother and her live-in boyfriend both worked third shift so they would leave the apartment at about 23:30 or so. They would leave the door locked, the living room light on and the TV going so people wouldn&apos;t try to bother us. I was awoken at probably around 00:00 or so for some reason. I didn&apos;t know why but it felt that I shouldn&apos;t be asleep. I kept having the feeling that something was outside or nearby that shouldn&apos;t be. I still fell asleep though. My sister came into my room at probably 01:00 or maybe later, but it was still nighttime and my mother still wasn&apos;t home. She said she was scared because she&apos;d seen grammy (our grandmother had died not very long before) and she said grammy had had big eyes and vampire teeth (just bear with me). I mumbled that she could sleep with me. Then, not too long after she woke me up again and she was crying now. She had supposedly seen a blue beam of light CREEP in through the window, touch the wall next to my bed, mere inches from us, then slowly ascend the wall. When it hit the thermostat it darted out of the room and she claimed to smell burning paper or wood. Despite wanting to know what happened and being scared, I fell back asleep. In the morning she told me grammy had come into my room and asked my sister to go with her. My sister asked: &quot;To heaven grammy?&quot; to which the apparition chuckled somewhat darkly and said: &quot;Not exactly.&quot; My sister couldn&apos;t remember anything after that until waking up. As I got older I began to become interested in many things, UFOs and the paranormal among the subjects and as I learned how many different ways aliens and supernatural forces come into contact with us, I couldn&apos;t help but wonder if this wasn&apos;t some kind of alien contact. I have heard that many abductees recall seeing familiar images instead of Greys or aliens, but with big eyes i.e. owls and monkeys with big eyes. I just kind of figured I would submit the report despite it taking place years ago."
"Lost timeI am writing this note after much anguish and deliberation.  I am not one to believe in this sort of thing, but the night of June 19 changed my life forever. I was driving down a road in the county coming home from a late night at work, when I thought I saw some lights over the trees in the distance.  I did not think too much about it, because I knew I was near the airport.  So I drove on for about 2 more miles, listening to my scanner.  Suddenly the channels started changing rapidly and the damn thing went nuts. Static, squeals, etc...  I was about to reach down and turn the thing off when the engine on my van quit.  The lights went out, and I rolled to a stop on the side of the road.  I tried and tried but the van would not start. I sat there for a moment, I got out my wireless phone, but it would not work, no signal nothing.  I was getting a bit pissed.  That is when I felt like I was being watched. Every hair left on my head stood straight up. Like when a baloon is rubbed on your head.  I heard a really loud noise, then nothing.  The van started, the scanner started too.  I had no idea what had happened, but I was tired and decided to go on home. When I got home, all the lights were out.  I went in and asked my wife why she went to bed so early. She said &apos;Early? It&apos;s 12:30!&apos;.  Well I nearly fell over. I checked my watch and it said 10:45! I got really concerned that I had blacked out or something, but I have no history of this. Then I started thinking maybe I was abducted by aliens! Then I thought I must be nuts!  I have struggled with this incident for a couple of weeks. I cannot sleep, I cannot eat, I have strange dreams. I feel like I am losing my mind, So at the sueggestion of a friend, I decided to write you guys instead of just putting a bullet in my head. I cannot figure out what happened to those two hours. They are just gone..... I am not nuts, or on medications, but I feel like I am getting worse everyday... Please help! You can call me at work toll free if you like. 1-800-((number deleted))((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken briefly over the telephone with the individual who submitted the report.  He sounds quite serious-minded, and seems to us to be a credible witness.  The case is in the hands of investigators.  PD))"
"I think I was Taken and accidently put in a different space time and then it was corrected.I have no memery of anything else.At the time of this incident I was fifteen years old. The day before I had escaped from the reformatory at Gatesville,Texas. I had gone through Clifton because I had reletives that lived there and was seeking help from them. They did not aid me of course so I walked on out of town trying to keep out of sight of the law. shortly after the sun came up I came into a small fishing community not far from Lake Whitney.Ther was a car there that had the keys in it setting along side of the road in front of one of the houses. Being on the run I stole it and headed out of town. When I felt I was clear I checked out the inside of the car and noticed I had three quarters of a tank of gas. The car also had a clock which I also noticed was running and showed at that time a quarter past six. The two things I mentioned helped me to realize that there was a time lapse that I could account for but that is getting to far ahead yet. I do not know where I was exactly but I had driven for about two hours and Ihad just looked at the clock and the gas gauge. The clock read 8:30 and the gas gauge showed a little less than half a tank. When I looked up from the dash, there was this bright light that actually hurt my eyes. when my eyes focused on the road there was a model &quot;A&quot; Ford truck with wooden side rails on it in front of me. It was green and looked new. There were two people rideing in it that I could see from the back window. The truck started slowing down and the driver gave the signal to turn left by sticking his hand out of the window. I slowed down but then that flash thing happened again. I was looking out of my right window to see where the truck had turned and there was no truck. There was no road there either. The sound of the truck had gone as well but I had heard it only moments before. I checked the rearview mirror and saw nothing. I was startled by this and looked at the clock to make sure I had not fallen asleep. The clock read ten fifteen. I looked at the gas guage. It was a little past half just like befor! e. I tap ped the guage but the needle stayed where it was. I had never heard of abduction or anything like that but could not figure out what had happened back then. I still cannot. I drove that car till it ran out of gas and didn&apos;t see another car or anyone for the rest of that day along that road. I do not know what road this happened on nor the exact day.((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1966 is approximate.  PD))"
"((NUFORC Note:  We are unable to confirm the representations made below, although the investigators cited by the witness are well known in the community of ufology.  We will make an effort to contact the investigators, in order to establish that they have investigated this case.  PD))Here is an unfiltered account of communications and interactions between a teenage human and a group of ET&apos;s.This happened 25 years ago  during a well documented UFO flap in 1977 in Gisborne New Zealand and the Waimata Valley near Gisborne.What I experiences seems quite different from what people talk about but this is how it happened., nothing is held back.I&apos;m free to talk about it now as this information is publicly available in space so it may as well be publicly available here too.Here it is, complete with spelling mistakes and typos.&quot;Here is what I wrote on an sighting report this year about the ET&apos;s experience with me:  they had the misfortune of trying to control a highly excited, disobedient teenage boy that was loose on their spaceship. It was fun for all of us and probably put the ET&apos;s off having human teenagers as children.I didn&apos;t need hypnosis to recall this. The ET&apos;s memory erasing methods didn&apos;t work on me, which also meant they couldn&apos;t control me while I was with them like they were used to controlling humans. By time they learned that is was too late for them to do anything about it.Please write an account of what happened This can be CSV delimited for your database.Date, 1977 Location, Waimata Valley NZ - I lived there on our family farm.Event Circumstances, It Happened during a UFO flap that centred on Waimata Valley and Gisborne at the same time UFO&apos;s were filmed from a plane over the South Island of NZ.Main Event, I was a guest on a scout UFO and was taken into space for urgent medical attention on a larger space ship when the operation in my nose went wrong.We&apos;d had UFO sightings reported for over 2 months along Waimata Valley Road near our house So I decided to sleep with a torch and the next time one flew over our house I&apos;d get out my window with the torch and start signalling it.One flew over our house and I jumped out the window and began signalling it.There were two ET&apos;s in a window looking down at me. I could read their telepathic conversation to each other, one was saying lets carry on, this is of no interest and the other said to wait, this could be of interest. At this point I was flashing the torch and waving at them like any excited kid and I thought &quot;yes - I&apos;ve won them over&quot;.The one that said this might be of interest immediately telepathically told me I had not won them over and next thing I remember I&apos;m in a corridor on the scout ship jumping up and down going it&apos;s true! it&apos;s true! you are real and there were at least 2 Et&apos;s just standing there looking at me trying to get a handle on the sight of an over excited teenage boy in pyjamas going off in front of them. What was of interest to them was that I could read their telepathic conversations to each other. I also learned they have ways of telepathically talking one on one and ensuring on ET nearby can listen on to the one on one chat.Once I&apos;d calmed down from hyperactive to just animated the tall one walked asked me why I had been unsure if they were real and why was I out there flashing my torch at them.  I replied that we&apos;d been told they weren&apos;t real and others were saying if they were real they were here to harm humans. I said they&apos;d been over our house for the past few months and I was still fine so obviously they were not here to hurt us so I decided to attract the attention of the next one that flew over our house.The tall one asked who was saying they were here to harm them and I said - the Americans said this all the time but I stopped believing that when they&apos;d been over our house for a few months and we hadn&apos;t been harmed by this. The Tall one was not happy to hear that I&apos;d been told ET&apos;s were here to harm humans. The tall one told me they&apos;d met humans and had not received a friendly reaction from humans. Humans had not made them feel welcome on Earth. I said well on behalf of humans they were welcome here. I think the Tall one and short ones were trying not to telepathically laugh at a human child welcoming them on behalf of humanity but I was so excited and I&apos;d blurted it out as I really wanted them to feel welcome.They told me the Russians were just like us and that I had to like the Russians as well as the Americans as we were all one species. This freaked me out and I had a stand up argument with them saying the Russians were not our friends as they were communists and if they were our friends why were they building so many more weapons than they needed and the Tall one kept saying we (communist or capitalist) must get along as we were all the same. I just couldn&apos;t accept this concept so we dropped the conversation and went to a room.A some point they put me in a trance to keep me in one place while they went to another room. I snapped myself out of the trance and went wandering around the corridors. A little ET spotted me and was surprised as was the Tall ET but the tall ET told the little ET I was safe so to let me look around. The little ET followed me everywhere during this phase. Then my time for medicals began so I went back to the room and got on the table/bed.There the tall one told me that they had not been offered much co-operation from Humans and it would like my assistance, by this time it was standing over a bench in the corner of the room preparing some hand held instrument and I was lying on my back on a body temperature metal or plastic table. I said I&apos;d be happy to help it, it could take off an arm if it wanted as long as it didn&apos;t harm my ability to think as that was important to me. It was touched by that remark and laughed that it didn&apos;t need an arm but would do other things.It did whatever it did then began to put a powered instrument up my nose. I said it looked like it would hurt me and it said if I liked it would stop any pain and I said yes please so it gave me the image of a moth crawling up my nostril while the instrument went in. While the instrument was up there doing whatever it did the ET dropped their guard and telepathically I picked this up so I seized the moment and jerked my head back violently with the instrument still active deep in my nostril. The ET was quick to stop the instrument but the damage had been done, it had sliced me up wherever it was inside my nostrils. The ET asked &quot; why did you do that&quot; and I said now you&apos;ll have to take me with you, you won&apos;t be able to fix that in time. There was a mini conference with the ET&apos;s in a corridor and the scout ship bolted to space.I was allowed out to watch as I felt the motion and I was over the moon as I felt this meant I was going with them to their planet. I saw the big ship as we approached it and was transferred to it to be repaired. Sometime during the repairs I realised I was to be returned to home and I was really upset by this so I tried to persuade them my parents didn&apos;t love me and I really wanted to go with them. They said I couldn&apos;t live with them and wouldn&apos;t explain why I couldn&apos;t then they showed me footage of my mother panicking in the house as she&apos;d gone to my bedroom and couldn&apos;t find me. They used this to show me my story about not being loved by my parents was not true as my mother was panicking so I had to be returned to her.I accepted defeat and went back to the scout ship to be returned. I asked them if they&apos;d visit us and would they please come for dinner and meet my family. The tall one asked if we would cook vegetarian and I said we had vegetarians but they were not normal, we all ate meat. The Tall one was not impressed with meat consumption. They said they would definitely be back.They dropped me off in daylight just in time for me to go to school.While wandering around the scout ship I&apos;d pocketed a small item. I&apos;d kept it with me and the little ET knew I had it. The big ET one either didn&apos;t know or pretended not to know that I had it. As I was being let out the door of the scout ship the little one said to stop me as I had an item of theirs. I was asked to stop so I did, no force was used. There ware about 4 of them grouped around me in the corridor and the tall one came over and said &quot; have you got anything&quot; I said no an the tall one immediately flashed me a telepathic warning that the others couldn&apos;t hear which said &quot;this is important - hand it over&quot; so I conceded defeat and handed it over and tried to justify it by saying &quot; I had to do it you know&quot; then I was transferred back to my bedroom.My father saw me being returned and wouldn&apos;t touch me until Mum made him. My mother was in the house.Unusual observations? Movements, sounds, lights, odours, etc Nothing unusual, it was a metallic disc that hovered quietly and had windows which I could see into when I was standing below it and I could see out of when I was in it. There were no surprises in the interior, it had corridors, separate rooms, a flight control area which was ergonomically correct for a 16 year old and which would have been relatively easy to learn as it looked conventional and uncluttered.The temperature was normal and the furniture was functional for humans as well as ET&apos;s. Any human would feel comfortable inside it.The ET&apos;s each had distinct personalities. The tall one who did the nose operation on me in the scout ship was very familiar with humans and was relaxed around me. I could chat telepathically with it and it loved talking, it was very enthusiastic about humans and their potential and was surprised humans had not been as positive in their attitudes towards ET&apos;s.There was also a short ET that was a bit shorter than me. It didn&apos;t trust me and kept following me around. It nearly freaked when I wandered into the flight deck and was leaning over the instrument panel/console. I told it when I grew up I was going to fly these (I meant planes as a pilot but it thought I meant fly UFO&apos;s - it dismissed the idea of me flying UFO&apos;s when I grew up as ridiculous). The short ET had very limited experience with Humans and felt we were barbarians - not to be trusted. It was watching me to learn more about this human species that it had been warned about but had not had not seen first hand before. That&apos;s the impression I was getting from it. I didn&apos;t help improve it&apos;s attitude as it caught me trying to steal a souvenir and it kicked up quite a stink when it looked like I was going to be released with the souvenir still in my procession.Describe your location relative to the sighting When the ship stopped above me it was say 10 - 20 metres above me and in front of me so I could easily see into it&apos;s windows and see the 2 ET&apos;s discussing me. It never landed I was in one spot one moment and in the ship in the next moment.Other people? Names, contact details Here are other events reported on the web concerning the UFO flap at the time 1. THE U.F.O. BBS - http://www.ufobbs.com/ufo  Originally dated 5 Aug 1993, 17:29 In the Waimata Valley, New Zealand, Decemebr 2, 1977, a farmer was awoken by his dog barking and, upon investigation, saw a landed &quot;flying saucer&quot; on the ground.  Two humanoids were carrying one of his dogs between them and moving towards the object.  They were 143 cm tall and wore close fitting, metallic silver overalls and white, opaque helmets.  These overalls were gathered at the ankles with elastic cuffs which extended over red glowing boots.  On the entities&apos; hands were large silver gauntlets with flared arm coverings extending half way up the forearms.  The white helmets were rounded like large motorcycle helmets and extended from shoulder to shoulder without any markings or openings.  Alarmed my this sight, the farmer fired a shot and apparently winged one of the entities for the two beings dropped the dog and the wounded one ran off into some nearby bushes while the other ran into the craft which took off at speed.This happened to a near neighbour a couple of miles up the Waimata Valley road from us. It happened about a week or two after the encounter the ET&apos;s had with me. We knew of it at the time and can believe is as both the residents and the ET&apos;s seemed comfortable with each other.The residents accepted the UFO&apos;s crop circles and occasional dead cow as &quot;just another day at the office&quot; and left the ET&apos;s alone and the ET&apos;s were quite cheeky with the frequency of their daytime as well as night time appearances and the evidence they were leaving around.The farmer probably shot the ET as he&apos;s shoot anyone who was stealing and hurting his dog.A story that went through Waimata Valley as that a couple of days after the event a distressed ET stepped on the road to flag down one of our neighbours as she drove to town. The silly lady floored it and left the ET by the roadside rather than stop and offer assistance. She missed an opportunity there 2.(1. Original investigation by Bryan Dickeson. 2. Retrospective investigation by Keith Basterfield &amp; Bill Chalker. 3. Dykes, M. (1981). &quot;Strangers In Our Skies.&quot; INL. Lower Hutt. pp46-49.) Three women were involved in an abduction case in the midst of a large UFO flap near Gisborne which began in 1977. One night they were lying on a hillside watching the skies, and felt that a period of &quot;missing time&quot; occurred. Shortly after the event a regression hypnosis session was arranged and an abduction scenario revealed. In 1989, during a retrospective investigation by Keith Basterfield and Bill Chalker, a regression session was conducted with one woman. This revealed an account of being drawn up a beam of light; of seeing one of the other women inside the UFO, and of talking to a male entity. All three women were then back on the hillside.I haven&apos;t been in touch with the above organisation but I probably know the girls involved in this report.3&quot; In late December 1978, air freight pilots reported seeing unusual bright lights hovering over Kaikoura, N.Z. Two weeks later, in January 1979, the mysterious lights returned and were videotaped by Australian and New Zealand TV news agencies.Following the sightings, the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RZNAF), the police and the Centre Observatory in Wellington cooperated in an investigation, the results of which were stamped Top Secret and lodged in the National Archives in Wellington.Calling the report &quot;a whitewash,&quot; Hassall was quoted by the New Zealand Press as saying, &quot;They discussed how to deal with the problem of (UFO) reports and they all agreed to cooperate and investigate... but not tell the public they were exchanging information. Secretly they were trying to figure it out. No one wanted to deal with the problem of UFO reporting. They didn&apos;t know what to do about them, partly through a lack of resources to adequately investigate them"
"five foot ball field size ufo&apos;s grand Island N.Y.1975+abduction!I WAS TAKEING A RIDE WITH MY GIRL FRIEND, AND WE WERE DOWN A ROAD THERE WITH TALL TREE&apos;S AND WOODED AREA ON THE WAY BACK TO THE BRIDGE AND HEAD HOME WHEN SHE SAID HAY WHATS THAT?

"A speeding craft and several lost hoursDuring this time I worked as an Insurance/Anuity Sales Person. I lived in Dallas but was working on assignment in the Houston area. It was Thursday night around 8:00 to 9:00 pm and I was driving back to Dallas (home) on Interstate 45. I had just passed through Conroe going north when my Ford Pick-Up just quit running, at 70 mph all the idiot lights came on and that was it. I coasted as far as I could then finally stopped knowing that 2 associates of mine would be coming by momentarily on their way back to Dallas and I&apos;d be rescued. I turned the emergency flashers on and went back and lowered the tailgate of the truck to sit on while I watched for my associates. After 10 minutes or so I looked up and noticed for the first time how beautiful the stars were out in the country without all the city lights to block them from view. I kept looking up until my neck started to hurt and then I remembered a 4 ft section of plywood that I had laying down in the bed of the truck. I also had several cement blocks among the other junk that seemed to always occupy the truck bed. I quickly got up and arranged the blocks so that they were under the plywood, holding it up at about a 30 degree elevation so I could lay down to look at the stars and still see the oncoming traffic. I laid down and began looking up at the stars. I had been watching the sky for about 30-45 minutes when I first saw it. It (the object) was really nothing more than a very bright light that appeared to be 10 to 20,000 ft. up.Nothing unusual, right? Nothing could be further from the truth. I watched this....thing....for what seemed to be about 30 minutes or so and during that time it went across the sky in mere seconds.....it made right angle turns......it got bigger and brighter and then dim again, it crossed the sky once more from east to west then in mid-flight just seemed to disappear. I mean one second it was there, then the next second it was GONE! Now up until this point in my life I had not ever thought much about UFO&apos;s however I was beginning to re-evaluate my way of thinking. Anyway, with that over my attention now was re-directed to watching for my associates and getting rescued from my predicament. As I sat quietly and watched for my friends it became increasingly clear that there was far less traffic on this road than there should be at 10:00 pm at night on an Interstate Highway, 60 miles out of Houston. Up until this point it had not dawned on me to look at my watch since I knew roughly what time it was, but when I did look at my watch I got the shock of my life....IT WAS 1:45 AM. IT WAS ALMOST 4 HOURS LATER! Reality started to set in at this point.....I must have fallen asleep and missed my associates.....but I DID NOT FALL ASLEEP! I REMEMBER EVERY LAST DETAIL OF EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED. This missing time thing was real creepy but I had more important issues to deal with at the moment. I got on my CB radio and called out for anyone that could help. After 30 or 40 minutes of doing that, I got a response. It was a partially loaded Car Hauler and the driver said for 50 bucks he&apos;d take me and my truck all the way to Dallas. What GREAT luck! In an hour or so we were loaded and on our way to Dallas. When we got back to Dallas we unloaded the truck and I thanked the driver and went into my house. Several hours later I went out to check the truck for problems. I got in and turned the ignition and it started right up. I never found any problems with the truck and it never repeated.It was a few years later that I heard about abductees and all that. I mentioned this to an acquaintance at work and this guy looked at me like I was a fool. He told everyone at work about it and then I was &quot;BRANDED&quot; The resident UFO Nut! It wasn&apos;t long before I was forced to quit this job and go elsewhere for work. I never mentioned this again before now.After this incident, my life took a nosedive into the toilet. It was weird. It was like I had a big sign on me that said &quot;UFO Freak&quot;. I went from a 6 figure a year sales career in insurance to selling cars for a living. As incredible as this may sound, I lost my ability to sell that night. From 80 to zero literally &quot;Overnight&quot;.I firmly believe that I was abducted that night. I don&apos;t remember any of it, but I know it happened....what else could explain the loss of time! If I ever find one of those people that can do hypnotic regression, I find out for sure. I hope that this is not too long but I know of no other way of explaining this to your readers.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have received many similar reports from across the U. S..

"was follow by object in edison, abducted for 4 hrs. returned to asbury pk saw craft on ground and in sky changed my life.left edison 1:30am, got on rt 287 south, toward garden state pky south, was drawn toward sky, saw large bright object, a light, used process of elimination. not a star, not a plane, not a helicopter, movements irratic, went fast then slow, then stoppd, then went , up, then down, back then forth. I thought outlout, what the hell is that? then i was filled with fear. i thought out loud, that thing is following me, that thing knows me, that thing knows who I am, that thing wants ME! rolled up window, turned on radio, looked again, it was gone from view but I knew that it was now above my car. now filled with fear.   the next thing I knew I felt like i woke up at the corner on sunset ave, the corner of sunset and main st in asbury park where I lived. thought, how did I get here, thats funny, don&apos;t remember driving. when the red light change to green i went straight across main st. i had to go past bond, then turn right on emery (or visa versa) passed lake to corner then turn left on to fifth and park in front of apt.   when I turned past the lake i was surprised by big lights behind pine trees that took up a large space, couldnt figure out how all of that &quot;what ever it was&quot; fit. stopped car, rolled down window, air was crisp, clear and cold. I looked and couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing. it was right there but unidentifiable. it was a big &quot;something&quot;, it made a low humming sound, it had red and green lights on it. i got scared and rolled the window up, drove to the corner, turned left and parkd in front of house. got out of car, looked toward lake. it was gone. i thought wow, what the helll was that. just then eyes were drawn toward sky, i had to bend way back to look at very huge object way way up in sky, but still close enough to observe. six or eight sides, dark brown, metallic, heavy. wondered how could it stay up there? red, green, white light, made no sound, wondered how something so big got from the lake to way up there in the sky so fast with out making any noise? windows went arou! nd. i could see in the windows. saw some people i thought. i was so afraid of it, i just looked at it and said out loud, &quot;take me&quot; I&apos;m yours. and a thought came immediately into my head. said, we already took you. we are bringing you back. i ran into the house. it was getting light out. it only takes 40 minutes to get from edison to asbury park, but hours passed, at least four, i wanted to go in and call the police, but i passed out cold. in the am around 10ish i woke up ran down stairs looked in sky but it was gone. for a long long time after i heard high frequency sounds in my head, my intuitive power was heightened and to this day i have experiences numerous spiritual experiences. called police two years later. they had nothing to say. went to local hypnotist years later. said it was a dream (not).had other encounters since then. not afraid any more. consider my self lucky for having had the experience. i have not been the same since. the experience changed my life. not business as usual. i noticed paramus 1978 had similar experience. okay. i know that i am not alone."
"copper colored-top shaped UFO sighted in elbridge,nyhere&apos;s my UFOstory. on january 30th,1995 i was in my car,on my way to work at SUNY of Environmental Science and Forestry(state college) in Syracuse,ny(central ny). i was working a 6 month data wiring contract there.  About 6:35AM i had just passed outside the village of elbridge,ny on rte 5,approaching the hill going towards camillus,ny. i approached  some high power lines going across the road (near pirro brother&apos;s ford dealership,feeks rd) and i see a large object between the 3 suspended wires. at first i thought it was a large balloon craft,but there was no basket attached. i looked at it trying to figure out what it was? my mind was searching for a familiar object to answer my question. as i got closer to it,i discovered that the object was a &quot;PERFECT TOP&quot; shape(like a kid&apos;s top) and it was a beautiful copper color like polished copper pipe. to give you a idea of the size,stretch your arm out directly in front of yourself and spread your fingers out wide. it was as tall in the sky as the distance between your pinky to your thumb(8-9&quot;high). i estimate the distance away, at 1 mile, and a about half mile high to the right and away from route 5.so,it was quite large. size was very hard to judge because there were no wheels,antennae,pipes,etc,it was just a &quot;DIVINE SHAPE&quot;,a perfect example of &quot;SACRED GEOMETRY&quot;. the most divine thing i&apos;ve ever seen. then,my mind continued inquiring&quot;WHAT IS IT?&quot; then,the hair on the back of my neck started to stand on end. &quot;OH MY GOD,IT&quot;S A UFO&quot;!. this is a very creepy feeling to look at something that big in front of you and not know what it is. it&apos;s very twilight zonish.then my mind said ,&quot;duh!,that&apos;s why they call them&quot;UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS&quot;. at that moment i realized the very &quot;meaning&quot; of those words. i didn&apos;t know if it was a craft,an entity or what.i continued to drive up the hill.looking back and to the right and seeing it. i felt safer driving and watching it,i didn&apos;t feel good about stopping the car and getting out and looking at it,i think i ! was worried about getting beamed onboard. another unusual thing was it was perfectly &quot;still&quot; in the sky,it did not move an iota. anything manmade moves in the sky.this was strange also,i was the only one on the highway that saw it,i kept looking to see if anyone else stopped or slowed down. there were cars ahead of me and behind me on both sides of the road. NO ONE ELSE SAW IT ! . i got farther down the road to route 690 and finally got to work. i couldn&apos;t wait to tell my 4-5 co-workers i knew i could trust in confidence. when i walked in to the office we had a group meeting,with 25-30 guys,so i couldn&apos;t say anything immediately,there were too many guys. during the meeting  a &quot;bizarre&quot; thing happened to my memory. I COMPLETELY FORGOT THE UFO AND DIDN&quot;T REMEMBER IT UNTIL APRIL !5TH. my mind went completely blank for 2 and a half months!  On april 15th,i was home watching &quot;unsolved mysteries&quot; and all of a sudden it &quot;clicked in&quot;,i told my nephew jim that i had seen a large MOTHERSHIP and had never told anyone! i couldn&apos;t believe i had forgotten it for 2 and a half months! i called the state police and reported it,also i wanted to know if anyone else had seen it. no one had. i also called a lady(an abductee) in syracuse that took UFO REPORTS. she told me that my memory lapse was completely normal and that it happens all the time. i didn&apos;t have any &quot;missing time&quot; that i&apos;m aware of. this is not the end of the story. in october of 1999 i met a clairvoyant in border&apos;s bookstore in syracuse,she had just recently written a book on future incarnations called&quot;sparks through time&quot;. i went to her booksigning and lecture.at the lecture i won a free clairvoyant reading from her. i told her i would call her at a later date after i figure out what i wanted to ask. i gave her no previous information. on december 13,1999 i called her and carefully phrased my questions. i asked if she could give me the significance of an incident that happened jan 30th 1995 at 6:35 AM in elbridge,ny. she contacted her guides and paused for a! few moments and then announced,&quot;YOU HAVE BEEN SHOWN THE PRESENCE OF ALIENS!&quot;. i was completely flabbergasted,it was so absolutely true,it just blew my mind she said that! she had verified my experience. she also told me that this was my 3rd experience(i don&apos;t remember the 1st two,it may have happened when i was a kid).but,it was also not my last either,i have others coming up in the future. this is not the end of the story. in february of 2001,my artist friend jack and i went for a ride and retraced the original ride and area so that he could do a painting of the original UFO site. we took many pictures from different angles,i wanted him to capture what i actually saw that january 30th morning. i told jack let&apos;s take a ride to the area a mile away which would have been exactly and directly under the UFO. from route 5,we turned right on lynch rd,went about 3/4 of a mile to the &quot; t &quot; and turned right on to halfway rd(i had never been in this area before). i told jack the that the UFO was still a ways a way and the very next left and half mile up that road would be where the ufo would have been. as we approached the next road,a tingling sensation went up my back and jack&apos;s also.THE NEXT ROAD WE WE TURNING ONTO,WHERE THE UFO WAS, WAS&quot;CAMPBELL&quot; RD(my last name). the topped shape-UFO had hovered over CAMPBELL RD like a gigantic exclamation point pointing the way. jack and i took this as a major sign and and confirmation of what i saw. after i saw this,i never had any doubts about my &quot;vision&quot; and that i was supposed to see this as part of my spiritual growth. this story is the absolute truth as i know it. WE ARE NOT ALONE! harry"
"Dreams or recollections of UFO abduction?In the mid-1990&apos;s, I don&apos;t remember the exact date, I was awakened one night from a dream by my own screams.  My wife, quite naturally, was awakened by my cries and frantically asked what was wrong. After calming down and bringing my heart rate down I told her that I had had a nightmare that seemed so real to me even after waking that I was shivering with fear.  It was a dream about a close encounter with a UFO. Before I go much further, let me tell you about myself.  I am a former United States Marine Corps aviator.  I flew as a ((deleted--senior crew member)) on KC-130 aircraft for ((deleted--approximately 10)) years.  I have an IQ that has been tested to be over 160, am well educated, well traveled and very well respected by my peers.  I am currently working as a field operations officer for a large multi-national, multi-billion dollar corporation and hold a great deal of responsibility in my position.  I am a practical, straightforward individual, known for my calm, reasoned, common sense approach to problem solving and crisis management.  I have an extensive knowledge of both military and civilian aircraft, their characteristics, abilities as well as appearance and am a licensed A&amp;P aircraft mechanic.  Back to my story... The dream I had just had was of me driving in a car which I recognized as a late 80&apos;s model Chevy Berretta.  In the car with me were 3 others, a female in the front passenger seat and a male-female couple in the back seat with the male behind myself.  As I recounted the dream to my wife we both assumed that the car in question was that of a friend of ours, ((name deleted)).  We both commented it strange that I would dream of driving her car as ((name deleted)) would never in a million years let anyone drive her beloved car. It also seemed strange to me that I did not recognize either of the females in the car as being ((name deleted)), or as my wife for that matter, but yet I felt some connection to the woman in the passenger seat.  I also felt as though we were driving home from the movies though it was more a feeling than any part of the dream. As the dream unfolded we were driving along a stretch of road which crossed under another hi-way, like an interstate.  After passing the interstate we approached a rise in the road.  From beyond the crest in the road there was a bright light as though a truck with its headlights on bright was approaching.  As we continued driving up the rise the light became intensely bright, so white it was tinged with blue and blocked out our vision of the surroundings, yet did not hurt the eyes. Once we crested the rise I was able to see a short valley that the road descended down into.  At the bottom of this depression there were two glowing objects.  Each was approximately 50 feet in height, cylindrical in shape with flared out conical bases.  (Very similar to the game pieces in the old game SORRY.)   The objects were sitting on either side of the road and were the source of the light, though no &quot;lights&quot; themselves could be seen.  It was as if the entire object was glowing with this intense blue-white light. When I was able to shake myself from the sight of these objects I could feel that I was no longer driving the car, we were being drawn towards them as though caught in the sci-fi classic &quot;tractor beam&quot;.  At this point I, along with my companions in the vehicle, began to scream.  It was at this point the dream ended and I awoke. (FYI: I have had goose bumps the entire time I wrote this.  I am hesitant to think about the dream very often these days.)  I had the dream only once.  I would sometimes think about it and try to place where the dream took place.  At this point it did not bother me much to think about the dream.  It was kind of a mind exercise to figure out where it had taken place.  The overwhelming feeling that I was driving ((name deleted)) Beretta home from the movies led me to believe that the dream took place in the suburbs of Chicago where I live and I imagined several likely locations, though none exactly matched the dream.  The fact that the car had a light color interior in the dream, and that ((name deleted)) car had a dark interior was another part of the dream which I could not rationalize. Over time I began to let the dream fade I rarely thought of it. About two years or so after having the dream I was in a conversation with some people talking about cars.  We were talking about the first car we ever owned and it was then that it hit me like a ton of bricks.  In the summer of 1988 I had left active duty in the USMC to go back to college and had bought a red 1988 Chevy Beretta with a light sand colored interior.  The car in the dream was mine.  Suddenly it all came back to me in a flash.  From that moment on the memory of the dream has never failed to bring on goose bumps, and occasional tears. The girl in the front seat was my girlfriend at the time, the man in the back seat her brother, and the other woman his girlfriend.  I was living in North Freedom, Wisconsin that summer of 1988 after taking a summer job in the area.  The four of us had gone to the movies at a drive-in early that evening in Madison and had returned home late.  We stopped in Wisconsin Dells and had gone skinny-dipping in the river at a place known as &quot;Bare-Assed Beach&quot;.  After getting in the car we drove back towards Baraboo to drop the three of them off before I drove on to North Freedom.  The next morning I remember waking in my bed with no recollection of the drive from the Dells back home. After my revelation I was able to place the hi-way we crossed under as I-94, though I do not know if it was the US Rte. 12 underpass or one of the ones west of there, but that is definitely the rough location of my encounter.  I have long since lost contact with my companions that night and have no idea if any of them have ever had similar dreams. As I have stated I only had the dream once. Several years later however, in the late 1990&apos;s I had a second dream more terrifying than the first. This time it all made sense from the start.  The dream took place in &quot;downtown&quot; North Freedom.  (I say downtown in quotes because it is such a small town, population 600, there is little else but a few lonely brick storefronts.)  The dream took place at night.  I was returning home from Baraboo in my 1988 Beretta and had arrived in North Freedom.  Being late at night the gas station was closed and there was nowhere to get a soda other than the Coke machine outside of one of the buildings downtown. As I got out of my car with the change for the machine in hand, I looked up into the cloudless sky and saw the millions of twinkling stars.  I just stood there and stared for a long while at them.  I had some training in celestial navigation and was trying to pick out the major constellations, planets and stars.  My stargazing over I then started walking across the main intersection in the center of town towards the pop machine.  As I walked I felt a slight tug at my jacket.  Then another tug.  Suddenly I felt myself being pulled upwards off my feet, into the air by collar of my jacket, my arms pinioned by the sleeves.  As I began to rise at a faster and faster rate I looked up again, but this time saw no stars.  Instead I saw large black circular object blocking the sky from my sight as it hovered overhead. At this point I again screamed and awoke. I guess I should also state that being a former Marine I do not scare easily and have never screamed that I can recall in my entire life.  Whether or not these are just dreams or actual encounters I do not know for sure, but I will say this, I have NEVER, EVER had such realistic dreams.  To this day I can see and feel every aspect of the dream; the colors, the smells, the fear.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the witness for taking the time to submit such an interesting report.

"((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Todd Lemire, State Director for Michigan MUFON, for following up on this report.  He can be contacted at &lt;tlemire@comcast.net&gt;.  We urge anyone with additional information about this case to contact Mr. Lemire directly.  PD))This report is in response to the following sighting as it appears on the NUFORC website.  It is a &apos;comment&apos; report on a follow-up investigation done by a Michigan MUFON Field Investigator. Occurred : 9/20/2003 18:00 (Entered as : 09/20/2003 18:00) Reported: 9/21/2003 6:45:44 PM 18:45 Posted: 9/24/2003 Location: Fraser, MI Shape: Light Duration:25-30 minutes star-like lights in the form of triangles and diamonds dancing in the late afternoon sky  My Brother was out in the yard and called to us to hurry and come look at &quot;this&quot;. In the sky directly above us were what we at first thought were hot air balloons that ascended so high they appeared to look like stars in the clear blue sky. There were 3 in a formation of a perfect triangle to the left and 4 to the right in the shape of a diamond. Then they began to dance in the sky with each other returning to their positions. Coming very close to each other but never colliding. There were 3 sets of these formations. One had a stream of light coming from it leading me to believe it was a hot air balloon but when it ascended up and disappeared I dismissed that idea. Nearing the 20 minutes of watching these star-like objects dancing in the sky others started to appear as dim stars and became brighter up to 50 were in the sky at one time dancing, but never colliding. They ascended and just disappeared. There was no sound, no aircraft in the area, no tails on the craft above us. The observers ranged in age from 81 a homemaker, a police detective (just retired)51, myself(laidoff)48, retired auto worker 53, spouse 54, niece 32, Ameritech line man, 51 and spouse, 51.  ------Being Report------- Comments on - WUFOD Case 2-826 - Fraser, MI Multiple Witness Daylight Sighting  I received FI (I.e. Field Investigator) David Twichell&rsquo;s photocopied forms and report on Sunday November 9, 2003.  My initial impression of this case was that it was a solid case that would produce quite an extensive report due to it being a daylight sighting.  The investigator originally included with his report a copy of the original WUFOD report in context of an email I sent him, Form 1 (2 pages), with an extra page for the spillover of the reporting witness&rsquo;s personal account, a 2 page hand-written description of the object by the witness, Form 2 (3 pages), Form 4 (1 page), Form 5 (1 page) with an added handwritten page describing the psychological and physiological effects as reported by the witness, a 3 page typed report by FI Twichell, a 2 page printout of the weather conditions for Mt. Clemens, MI on September 20, 2003, a one page small printout of a map of the sighting location and two cassette tapes of the phone interviews of all witnesses involved. There were 8 witnesses in total however after all was said and done only 1 witness&rsquo;s signature and form are on file with Michigan MUFON.  The 1-hour onsite interview was done on November 3, 2003 with R G and her mother S at R&rsquo;s home.  Afterwards, R met with FI Twichell at a local Tim Horton&rsquo;s restaurant, for another hour, to further discuss her possible abduction, as she didn&rsquo;t want to discuss this in front of her mother.  The attention of the investigator has been drawn towards R G, who appears to be the dominant witness and whom initially filed the report.  I will summarize my thoughts on the other witnesses accounts first, then R G&rsquo; account, and finally on the case as a whole. MA D, wife of L D, described the event in a very straightforward serious manner, with excellent detail.  The time of the event as noted by M A was around 4:00 pm (2 hour discrepancy here compared to other witnesses T.L.) or a bit thereafter.  She mentions that one of the objects could&rsquo;ve been a &lsquo;party balloon&rsquo; floating upward with a spiral tail attached to the balloon.  She mentions that L, her husband, in fact said it was a party balloon.  M is in agreement with most of the other witness&rsquo;s in the fact that she stated she was facing south and the objects were moving from west to east.  She suggested that she thought it may have been a &lsquo;weather gadget&rsquo; as appears in the movie &lsquo;Twister&rsquo;, and may have had something to do with weather testing.  She mentions a 45-minute duration to the sighting.   She described the movements of the clusters of objects as being &lsquo;like a butterfly&rsquo;, no jerky movements.  She also didn&rsquo;t report any physiological or psychological effects as a result of this sighting. L D, the witness who was first to see the objects mentions them catching his eye while he was walking up the back steps, to go in the house, around 3:55 pm.  He was looking towards the west at about 40o up from the horizon.  He stated the sighting duration was approximately 47 minutes.  He too reported no physiological or psychological effects as a result of this sighting.  He mentioned initially seeing 7 shiny &lsquo;dots&rsquo;&hellip;. 3 being in a &lsquo;straight line&rsquo;, and 4 being shaped in a &lsquo;straight edged arch&rsquo;.  He mentions some of the objects rotating around in a circle very slowly.  Most of his account matches closely with that of his wife M A and that leaves me with the question of, &ldquo;Was there significant collaboration between the two witnesses resulting in some level of contamination in these two accounts?  This seems most evident in the time at which they estimated the sighting began. S D - L&rsquo;s Mother - The initial part of this taped conversation has only the voice of FI David Twichell due to the fact that his speakerphone was not turned on. After David asks her about what time [the sighting began - T.L.] there is some silence and then David mentions a time of 6:30 pm during the early part of their conversation.  I&rsquo;m making what I believe is a valid assumption, based on the taped conversation, that they are speaking of the onset of the sighting event.  She mentions her friends present at the sighting location counting about 8 -10 lights. She stated they were moving around one another and darting back and forth.  She also mentions a sighting duration of 15-20 minutes.  Here we see a large discrepancy in the time of the event onset and the sighting duration as compared to L and M A&rsquo;s account.  S states the objects were seen &lsquo;overhead&rsquo; in the southeast initially and then darted to the west for a short distance further stating that she didn&rsquo;t have to move her head very much to follow them.  She mentions also that the sun had set approximately 1 hour after the objects disappeared.  The sunset, as listed at the bottom of the weather data, was at 7:30 pm so her approximation of the onset of the event being at 6:30 pm could very well be correct.  She too mentions the possibility of the objects being helium balloons. She also stated she was emotionally excited and had &lsquo;chills&rsquo; up and down her arms.  This witness has had a previous sighting of a cigar-shaped object, which she experienced in Canada but no specific information was given about this sighting. AM G - She initially states the time of the sighting started at 5:30 pm.  She states she was initially facing south, which is in agreement with most of the other witnesses.  She mentions the objects slowly moving, or drifting across the sky and that she watched them for approximately 2 hours (a notable discrepancy in the sighing duration here - T.L.).  For the most part the description of the objects is in agreement with the others.  She states she suffered from no physiological or psychological effects, however she does mention one interesting effect and that was she saw &ldquo;little white specks&rdquo; like TV static in her eyes due to her head being craned up towards the sky.  She had to repeatedly look down to relieve this effect and readjust her eyes.  She believes this may have been due to her looking up in the sky for long periods of time.  She said the objects were at an elevation of approximately 80o to directly overhead. (Here too is a discrepancy in what was said to be a 40o elevation for the objects mentioned by the initial witness L. - T.L.)  J G had very little to add to this investigation.  His interview was extremely short.  He was in the house watching a football game and showed very little interest in determining what the others were viewing.  He states the sighting onset was approximately 6:00 pm.  He stated he didn&rsquo;t look at the objects long enough to discern much detail.  He stated what he saw was a bunch of cluster type star shapes and then went right back in to watch the football game, not looking at them long enough to even determine if they were moving.  He stated that the other witnesses stayed outside for 15-20 minutes watching the objects. M Z stated onset of sighting event was about 5:30 pm.  She stated she saw white &lsquo;balls&rsquo; like a balloon but it wasn&rsquo;t a balloon.  She states there was about 15-20 of them and the sighting duration was a good 45 minutes.  She stated that the objects were in different areas and not in one spot.  The witness says they [her and the other witnesses] were all kind of nervous.  M stated that R called [reported them to MUFON] because her and her mother thought these were some kind of thing from outer space.  She states the objects were moving in different directions, yet says that it could&rsquo;ve been the wind blowing them.  She said at no time did they change color.  No physiological or psychological effects noted by this witness.  Witness, in my opinion, seemed very hesitant to give out her address, and left only her phone number with FI Twichell.  Her husband M was interviewed later. MZ stated he saw 10 whitish things that could&rsquo;ve been balloons.  He didn&rsquo;t watch them too long and didn&rsquo;t think anything of it.  Stated it didn&rsquo;t interest him so he went back in the house.  Onset of event he says was 5:30 - 5:45 pm.  To him it looked like balloons.  He stated they were kind of drifting not going any certain way.  Objects were at a high altitude.  He watched the objects for approximately 5 minutes.  Nothing unusual noticed, as they were too far away to tell.  No color changes noticed.  Very short interview&hellip;approximately 3 minutes. R G, the witness who reported this incident, was affected quite differently by this event.  She states the onset of the event was around 6:00 pm with a total duration of 25-30 minutes, which fits in well with most of the other witness&rsquo;s accounts, except for those of L and MA D.  She first thought these were hot air balloons.  She went on to describe their movements using the word &lsquo;dancing&rsquo; meaning they would move towards and away from, and around each other.  She initially saw 7 objects in two different groups.  She describes the color as being dim blue then turning brighter.  She goes on to describe in detail, as evidenced in the taped interview, many perceptions that weren&rsquo;t described by the other 7 witnesses.  R&rsquo;s size estimation being that of an aspirin, as suggested by the FI is quite in opposition to the starlike description given by the other witnesses.  She relates her account in a very excited way with a lot of emotion in her voice.  The other witnesses sounded much calmer when relating their accounts. R mentions another sighting she witnessed about 17 years ago in which she called Selfridge ANG at that time as well, with no response from her message left on the automated answering system at the base.  20 minutes into her phone interview R adamantly mentions there was not a plane anywhere in the sky.  She then mentions, about 27 minutes into the interview that &ldquo;after, a jetliner was by and it was higher than that&rdquo;.  This point being unclear as to whether or not the objects were in the sky during the time the plane was seen.  I asked FI Twichell to clarify this if he could.  He states, &ldquo;As to the plane involved in the sighting of Sept. 20th, I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m not making myself clear on this.  I didn&rsquo;t make a copy of the recorded interviews so I can&rsquo;t check them for clarity but the witnesses agree that they did not see any conventional aircraft in the sky until the very end of the sighting episode.  While the objects were still above them, a jet, coming from the direction of Selfridge, came into view and headed in the direction of the objects.  At this time, the objects ascended and were gone from view.  MA stated that the plane was visible while the objects were still visible. R goes on to mention her husband&rsquo;s flu-like illness previous to the sighting and it&rsquo;s complete reversal during the sighting, and then a subsequent relapse afterwards.  She feels this may be relevant.  Her husband did not mention this during his interview.  R also noticed a definite difference in local animal activity whereas the others did not, and also mentioned an eerie silence during the event.  She goes on to describe the remainder of the sighting as mentioned within David&rsquo;s report. David then sent another report to me, via email, dated October 2, 2003 regarding RG&apos;s possible abduction event.  This report brings up the question as to why this wasn&rsquo;t mentioned in her initial telephone interview with David.  I believe there is some level of malleability evident within R.  I posed a few intentional leading questions to David that he posed to R.  I asked, &ldquo;Was there any physical evidence left as a result of these abductions?&rdquo; and she replied, &ldquo;I have a scoop marking on the left lower leg learing [nearing? T.L.] the front of my shin. Also on my right leg the first night of my &quot;dreams&quot; I recall injuring the inside of my leg just above my ankle with a terrible hemotoma, as I hit it trying to run away, I believe. When I returned to my bed there was dirt and tiny stones in my sheets and I had no socks on. (I ALWAYS wear socks to bed) The hemotoma was so bad I thought I had broke my leg...I iced it for several days. Today my flesh is still discolored, but it is no longer black and blue it is a dark reddish with a slight purple tint color that you would see from a fresh bruise. It is 4 inches across by 2 1/2 inches up and down. I will say this... when my doctor saw this back in May, he said it was a terrible bruise and it would heal right up with time... I never brought it up again.&rdquo;  It is difficult for me to understand her knowledge of how &lsquo;scoop marks&rsquo; are associated with abductions without any previous knowledge of UFOs or the abduction phenomena. Another question asked was, &ldquo;Did these abductions take place at the same time on each consecutive day?&rdquo;  She replied, &ldquo;Yes they took place at the same exact time each night consecutively @ 3:00 A.M. This is the first time I recall distinctively the time. I see the time on my clock in my room and I cannot wake my spouse. I am being pulled by my feet from my bed.&rdquo;  Another question asked was, &ldquo;Any poltergeist type activity in the home before or after the abduction event? She replied, &ldquo;There has been an abundance of poltergeist type of activities in my home from the toilet fully flushing and the handle moving to the downward position. We have had books moved from bookcases and placed opened onto the table, mostly civil war books. I have had my college papers missing and my books only to look feverishly for them and they appear before my eyes as I could have stumble over them. We have gotten phone calls with tones instead of static and we have caller ID... nothing appeared or registered.  My sister came over and did a Catholic exorcism in my home with a tape and holy water saying prayers and Blessed candles lit. I was still in tears from the &quot;dreams&quot; and emotionally upset because I hadn&apos;t saved the baby... unable to sleep or eat, and did not want to be bothered by anyone as I felt they did not understand my emotional state. Oh yes! The radio would turn on in the bedroom and change radio stations from one to another and another and another.&rdquo;  I believe her emotional state at the time of the above exorcism up until the September sighting event and possibly afterwards may be an important aspect of this case and should be looked into further, probably by Dr. T.  FI Twichell states that R claims not to have been previously interested in the UFO phenomenon prior to this event. She said that she hasn&rsquo;t read any books or watched any documentaries on the subject.  If this is true then her &lsquo;abduction dream&rsquo; is simply astounding and would correlate well with other KNOWN abduction accounts, however the question remains with me, where would she have obtained knowledge of the often reported, &lsquo;scoop mark&rsquo;. According to R, there also appears to be evidence of an abrupt change in her personality.  There also appears to be other serious differences of opinion and disagreements between R and her other family members regarding the above-mentioned exorcism, matters regarding R&rsquo;s mother, and her husband&rsquo;s health issues that may be compounding factors in this case which would best be dealt with by Dr. T.  Again, a further in-depth background check would be necessary to confirm these personality changes as well as any family problems now existent and any previous interest she may have regarding the UFO phenomena. On Form 2, first page, under &lsquo;Shape&rsquo; I noticed that &lsquo;disk&rsquo; was checked off but I hadn&rsquo;t heard any witness mention anything about a &lsquo;disk&rsquo; shape to these objects.  I queried David about this and he replied, &ldquo;The one object that appeared to be larger than the others, with the curly-Q tail, was described by R G as being more disk-shaped than star like. She was the only witness that made this observation.  I&rsquo;m not aware of where this statement appears in the context of the material that has been made available to me (T.L.). I completed forms 4 &amp; 5 as indicated on the forms.  These were sent by the FI, via postal mail, to the witness to be completed and signed.  Once she returned them he felt they shouldn&rsquo;t be altered after her signature was placed on the form.  I added the necessary data in order to complete the forms. At this time R&rsquo;s possible abduction event and the sighting that was initially reported to MUFON will be handled as separate entities.  WUFOD, NUFORC and Filer&rsquo;s Files were checked for sighting reports that may be relevant to this report but nothing of any significance was discovered.   This sighting was also reported on September 21, a day previous to it being reported to WUFOD, to Peter Davenport&rsquo;s NUFORC website.  See http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31702.html I&rsquo;m not aware of any other communications between R and Mr. Davenport.  Mr. Davenport has made the original report available to me. Due south of the sighting location is Victor Airway 221- 464 which is on an 85o (E-W) heading.   Wind direction from ground level (329 ft. at DTX weather station at Pontiac White Lake) to ~35,000 ft. ranged from 240o - 270o (blowing from the west to east approximately) at speeds ranging from to 6 - 50 mph respectively.  From 35,000 ft. to 97,000 ft. the wind direction was a bit more sporadic, ranging from 20o - 240o at speeds ranging from 58 - 3.5 mph respectively. These figures were taken from radiosonde data from the above-mentioned Nexrad weather station located approximately 30 miles northwest of the sighting location near Waterford, Michigan.  Archived NOTAM&rsquo;s (Notice to Airmen) were also checked for the date in question but nothing of note was listed. In my opinion it is evident that helium balloons tied together could account for some of the movements described by the majority of the witnesses.  As far as the event time and sighting duration discrepancies are concerned I would tend to think the 6:00 pm time range is correct due to the fact that the party was completed and the cleanup had begun.  The football game (Michigan vs. Oregon) was televised at 3:30 pm with the postgame show starting at 6:30 pm.  The sighting duration discrepancies are wide ranging but all estimates are, as far as typical UFO sightings are concerned, rather long in duration.  This would make me lean even further towards the &lsquo;balloon&rsquo; hypothesis as a possible explanation due to the objects slow and drifting movements.  There are some aspects such as the color change and &lsquo;beam of light&rsquo; or &lsquo;light bar&rsquo; noted by a few of the witnesses that would be difficult to explain via the balloon hypothesis, other than it being some type of reflective string used to tie the balloons together. Overall, I would have to evaluate this sighting as BORDERLINE IFO due to the distance between the witnesses and the objects, the object&rsquo;s &lsquo;point like&rsquo; appearance yielding no notable surface characteristics or structure, and their slow drifting movements. Currently R G has been put in touch with Dr. T concerning her abduction type experiences and she may be scheduling a regressive hypnosis session in the near future.   I feel that her abduction experiences, and their associated emotional difficulties, should be dealt with by a qualified Doctor who can separate the abduction experiences from the more &lsquo;normal&rsquo; emotional difficulties that may have arisen due to unrelated health and family issues which R G is facing. This could possibly provide her some relief or coping mechanism for both situations.  Todd Lemire Chief Investigator - Michigan MUFON December 2, 2003  ------End Report---------"

Todd Sees came to mind immediately when I first heard this story.Donnie  ((END))  ((NOVEMBER 27, 2003, COMMUNICATION BY KENNY YOUNG, ON CURRENT-ENCOUNTERS LIST))  SUBJECT: Unusual situation and &apos;bright lights&apos; LOCATION: Morehead, KY (Rowan County) DATE: Sunday, November 23, 2003 TIME: Around 10:00 p.m. This is a follow up to a N.U.F.O.R.C. sighting report that was just posted by Peter Davenport  SUMMARY  A report was submitted to The National UFO Reporting Center concerning a strange situation taking place near Morehead, Kentucky. The report stated: &quot;Morehead-Rowan Co. Rescue Sq.had a call from Morehead Police Dept. of a female crying for help three times  From 2 witness then they was a bright light in the sky for about 1 min. RESCUE SQ.arrived on scene and started searching the area 1st &amp; 2nd witness reported seeing this. The fire dept. was ask to begin searching with the thermal imaging camera with no results found. Res.of Morehead was one of the witnesses.Unless there is a confirmed report of a missing person,the search will not be continued.&quot;   INVESTIGATION  This morning I contacted the Morehead Police Dept at (606-784-7511) and talked to two very nice officers that were in the department (located at 105 E Main St Morehead, KY). I asked the first dispatcher if he could provide any information about an unusual report I had concerning mysterious lights seen near Morehead. &quot;I think that was from the Rockfork area,&quot; he said, &quot;and it was the northern lights, what they call an aurora. We had some calls on it. We had a report of the northern lights in the area.&quot;  The dispatcher also informed that no officers reported the lights. &quot;There were some calls on it, one female caller reporting something in the sky, but it was the aurora borealis.&quot;  I asked if the calls were related to the report of &quot;screaming sounds&quot; and the dispatcher said he did not think so. I asked if there was a search conducted and he did not know for sure and began checking the logs. There was some confusion as to the date of event but found from his logbook he informed that a search was undertaken near Adams Lane on Sunday evening, November 23. &quot;There was some type of search because of a woman screaming, I think,&quot; he said, and also checked with another gentleman who was in the office, the captain of the fire department. I could overhear the gentleman talking (his name may have been Randy) who was knowledgeable about the situation. I then asked if I could speak directly with this person. The Captain of the Fire Department came to the phone and said that on Sunday night, November 23, persons near Adams Lane began hearing a woman screaming three times around 10:00 p.m. &quot;We had a report of a woman screaming and then they didn&apos;t hear it no more,&quot; said the Morehead, KY fire official, &quot;they called and the local rescue squad went out there, the fire department and the police went out and a search was conducted. The search used a thermal imaging device and lasted for about an hour and a half when it was called off.&quot;  &quot;We thought it might have been two kids who got scared,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe one scared another and they were frightened.&quot;  I asked the fire official if he had any knowledge about the bright light in the sky seen for one minute and he said: &quot;I got there at the tail end of things so don&apos;t know anything about it. I didn&apos;t see anything myself.&quot;  I asked if he heard anyone else talking or rumors of a bright light in the sky during the time frame of the search and he said &quot;no.&quot;  COMMENT  The two officers at the Morehead Police Department were kind and helpful. They were able to validate the report of &apos;mysterious screams&apos; that appeared on N.U.F.O.R.C.but did not have any information to link the 3 mysterious screams directly to a ighting of a &apos;bright light&apos; in the sky. The first officer said the bright light, seen a couple of days earlier, was caused by the Northern Lights or Aurora Borealis, yet it seems unusual to think that several residents, as described, would see a pretty sunset and interpreted the situation in such a manner as to contact local police authorities. Further, the initial report to N.U.F.O.R.C. sought to link the sighting of the bright light in the sky directly to the scream/search event and seemed to suggest that a &quot;Res.&quot; of Morehead was one of the witnesses. &quot;Res.&quot; might mean &apos;resident&apos; or &apos;rescue&apos; as in rescue worker. The poorly worded report also does not indicate what this &apos;Res&apos; was a witness to, exactly. Also, there may be some issue as to the time listed on the N.U.F.O.R.C. report as the claimant logs the event as occurring on 11/21/2003 when the dispatcher said the search took place Sunday evening, 11/23/2003 (and also noted that the northern lights were seen &quot;a couple of days earlier&quot;). Northern Lights have been prominent lately due to increased solar eruptions and flares from the sun. Thanks to Peter Davenport, Donnie Blessing  Filed, November 27, 2003 KENNY YOUNG   Dear List: At approx. 11 A.M. today, December 2nd, 2003 I spoke with another witness to the amazing UFO/Screaming woman incident in Morehead, Ky.The claimant, who is ex-military, informed me that she and her daughter witnessed the same UFO as it came down near to her home. Her testimony fits the same statements made by the prior witness, Mr. Virgil Davis.  A full report of the claimant&apos;s story will follow shortly.  The mystery of this case only deepens as this story unfolds.Filed 12/2/03 Donnie Blessing Southern Ohio Section Director MUFON  ((END))  ((NOVEMBER 30, 2003, POSTING TO CURRENT-ENCOUNTERS LIST BY KENNY YOUNG))  C.C.CURRENT ENCOUNTERS &quot;OPP-APP&quot; List  A short time ago I located and interviewed a very credible witness in Morehead, Kentucky that has provided me with a sober link between a UFO sighting and bizarre report of desperate and blood-curdling screaming sounds heard at the same location immediately after the unidentified flying object had departed. After the conversation I had to call a &apos;time out&apos; and take some time to contemplate over this development as the report is terribly interesting. It is one of the best reports I have ever taken as I am impressed with the witness  and extreme strangeness of the case. I will prepare the details of this case shortly and have a report put together in the next hour or so. The witness did not report this except to the police and has no idea how it ended up at NUFORC (Peter, can you help if you retain a source for the original report?).As stated earlier, the Morehead police department was dismissive of this incident, when I contacted them they acknowledged a search party and report of screaming sounds but said that &apos;northern lights&apos; were seen in the area. From my conversation with this very credible witness, northern lights can be positively ruled out.This is a real mystery. Full report is pending.... KENNY YOUNG  ((END))  ((NOVEMBER 30, 2003, POSTING TO CURRENT-ENCOUNTERS LIST BY KENNY YOUNG))  SUBJECT: Screaming sounds firmly linked to UFO sighting LOCATION: Morehead, Kentucky (Rowan County) DATE: Friday, November 21, 2003 TIME: Between 9 and 10:00 p.m. SUMMARY  In effort to further explore the report of &apos;unidentified lights&apos; and screaming sounds alleged in Morehead, Kentucky, an internet search was conducted to retrieve the address and phone numbers of residents of ((deleted)) (law officer earlier contacted had advised of the search taking place near this location). After a &quot;reverse lookup&quot; was conducted at the internet resource Http://www.theultimates.com one residency was identified on ((deleted)) Lane in Morehead, Kentucky. That number was called around 6:30 p.m. this evening (Sunday, November 30, 2003) and I inquired if anyone could help me with information about the report of screaming sounds heard around one week earlier. The call was received by Dr. ((name deleted)), a ((deleted)) college professor. &quot;I was here when the screams were heard,&quot; he said.  &quot;There were some loud, blood-curdling screams but nobody could find out anything more.&quot;  I then asked if Dr. ((name deleted)) knew anything about any UFO sighting and he said: &quot;Yes, I saw it.&quot;  Dr. ((name deleted)) said that he was driving toward his home on Friday, November 21 between 9 and 10:00 p.m. with his 2 sons, 15 and 18-years old (He recalls the specific date, knowing that one son is in college and would not have been home any day except Friday). While driving, they all spotted a soundless aerial object over a nearby open field that was described as an oval-shaped, white-colored light source as big as a pea held at arms length which moved &apos;like a hummingbird would move.&apos;  The object, seen in the dark and clear night skies, was relatively high when first seen and was &quot;coming down, moving in increments as if an elevator would drop and stay there awhile, then drop and stay there awhile,&quot; Dr. ((name deleted)) said. After the first 3 or 4 minutes of visual observation, the object began moving around to different parts of the sky. They got out of car to see if they could identify this object and verified to their satisfaction that the object was not a plane, helicopter or aurora borealis. &quot;My first inclination was to rationalize what this object could have been,&quot; Dr. ((name deleted)) said. &quot;rather than jumping to conclusions. After we ruled out the various possible explanations we assumed that this was a UFO.&quot;  &quot;I know for a fact that there was no explanation for this object and I&apos;m just glad I had my two sons with me to see it,&quot; he said. After observing this object for a few minutes, Dr. ((name deleted)) and his 2 sons got back in the car and drove on to their home under a certain sense of apprehension. &quot;I would say that our feeling was more a sense of apprehension than fear,&quot; he said, &quot;I did not know what it was we were looking at and had some concern that it might or could have spotted us.&quot;  After driving the short distance to their house, they went to a second floor bedroom and looked out the window to the northwest where they continued to watch the object. It descended lower toward the ground and seemed to be settling in a nearby field where its color had shifted from a white to an orange. As the object got lower and lower to the ground, it became bigger and its color changed to a reddish light. He said that the size of the object increased from a pea at arms length to a dime at arms length, stressing that its size, from his perspective, was &quot;not quite as drastic as a nickel at arms length.&quot;  &quot;There was like a vacuum of silence while we watched this,&quot; Dr. ((name deleted)) said, &quot;it was like everything was real quiet, at a standstill and then when it became a red color, everything went crazy.&quot;  Dr. ((name deleted)) said that animals in the area suddenly erupted in a frenzy. His neighbors dog was barking crazily and his German Shepherd dog tried to break its chain. From his perspective, the object descended to the ground but was not certain that it touched or made contact with the ground as trees prevented him from seeing this with certainty. &quot;At that point, after this object got red, it just &quot;shot off&quot; like a dart, some kind of acceleration and it just took off to the west. We just stood there dumbfounded.&quot;  He said the sighting lasted for an estimated 10 to 15 minute duration. &quot;I was very reluctant to call the police about a UFO sighting,&quot; he said, &quot;at that point, we were not going to report this.&quot;  &quot;Right after that my 2-sons went back outside and heard the screaming. It was a female voice. They got in the car and within minutes had called from their cell phone to say that they had been hearing screaming sounds in the field where this thing came down,&quot; he said. &quot;Approximately 20-minutes after the UFO sighting the police were at my door, there were about 20 officers and a rescue squad over in the field where I spotted the UFO. They were combing the area and had asked me what I knew about someone screaming.&quot;  &quot;Apparently, others had heard the screaming sounds.&quot;  I asked Dr. ((name deleted)) if he could explain what was heard and he emphasized that he did not hear the screaming sounds himself, that his 2 sons heard the disturbing commotion, along with other residents in the area that notified law enforcement. Dr. ((name deleted)) paused from our conversation to check with one of his sons, asking if he could recount the nature of the screaming sounds. He said it was a desperate, blood curdling scream of a female voice that kept saying: &quot;Help me, oh my God, help me!&quot;  &quot;Apparently several people had heard the screaming, I don&apos;t know how long it lasted,&quot; he said. When the police arrived at his doorstep knocking on his door (an estimated 15 minutes after the UFO departed), Dr. ((name deleted)) volunteered information about the UFO sighting. &quot;I took the officer to the side and explained to him that this is going to sound crazy, but I need to tell you what I saw tonight.&quot;  &quot;I told the police about the UFO after they came to the door, I don&apos;t know if anyone else saw the UFO but the officer taking my report took me seriously. He didn&apos;t write anything down while I talked with him,&quot; Dr. ((name deleted)) said. When asked if the police officer indicated that anyone else had also witnessed the UFO, Dr. ((deleted)) said that the police officer said he had seen a UFO also, but was uncertain if he was referring to the same object or a separate, unrelated sighting. Dr. ((name deleted)) said that aside from reporting this to the police officer who knocked on his door, he had not reported this sighting to any other person and that he was not the source for the report which was submitted to The National UFO Reporting Center. He was puzzled how the report made it to NUFORC and said that neither he, nor his sons, reported the sighting to anyone. &quot;I&apos;m still trying to figure out who reported this,&quot; Dr. ((name deleted)) said after our conversation. He went on to say how he got &quot;freaked out&quot; when the cops came to the door asking about the screaming sounds. He described the area of his residence as isolated and surrounded by fields and woodland. His road is paved. He emphasized that the screaming sounds came from the immediate area where the unidentified object had came to the ground. &quot;The screaming sounds came from the field, and I have no explanation for it.&quot;  Dr. ((name deleted)), who teaches ((deleted)) for the ((deleted)), also said that he had previously seen a UFO when he was in his Freshman year in college at ((deleted)) in 1976. He said the object was similar to what he saw on Friday, November 21, 2003. COMMENT  I am deeply impressed by Dr. ((deleted)) and his efforts to remain objective and rationalize various explanations about the sighting. Based on his observation, the object in question is nothing to do with Aurora Borealis or &apos;northern lights.&apos;  Dr. ((deleted)) allowed permission to use his name and employment in this report, having no objection to it attached with the UFO sighting and situation involving a search party near his home. Information furnished by Dr. ((deleted)) sheds new light on this case. Comments from him directly contradict the dismissive approach taken by law officers in remarks made during earlier inquiries (who also incorrectly advised that the event was on Sunday, November 23) regarding a UFO situation that corresponds with the screams. When informed that a Morehead policeman and a fire rescue officer told me that &quot;someone had seen the northern lights,&quot; Dr. ((name deleted)) scoffed at the suggestion and was in disbelief. &quot;I can&apos;t believe they said that, this was definitely not the northern lights.&quot;  He said that tomorrow he will inspect the 50-acre field where the object descended. The report to N.U.F.O.R.C. suggests that the UFO was also sighted by witnesses with the rescue squad responding to the scene. This might suggest that the screaming sound was heard simultaneous to the visual sighting of the UFO. Peter Davenport of N.U.F.O.R.C. states: &quot;The person who submitted the sighting report for Morehead, KY, provided no personal or contact information, to include no e-address.  It &quot;reads&quot; as if it was submitted by a member of the team that was dispatched, i.e. it reads as if someone just copied a written record of the dispatch.  I would have responded to the report, save for the absence of any means of contacting the source.&quot;  That report states: &quot;Morehead-Rowan Co. Rescue Sq.had a call from MPD of a female crying for help x3. From 2 witness then there was a bright light in the sky for about 1 min. RESCUE SQ.arrived on scene and started searching the area 1st &amp; 2nd witness reported seeing this .The fire dept.was ask to begin searching with the thermal imaging camera with no results found. Res. of Morehead was one of the witnesses. Unless there is a confirmed report of a missing person, the search will not be continued.&quot;  The report of desperate, blood curdling screams from a woman crying &quot;Help me, Oh God, Help me&quot; mar this case with a disturbing sense of unusual dread. Clearly, there was a problem taking place and this report raises the specter of reported UFO/human abduction or interaction. Morehead, Kentucky is an estimated 45-miles south of Flemingsburg, Kentucky, where a crop formation appeared in a Rye Field in the spring of this year. A flap of crop formations and UFO sightings also bewildered Southern Ohio in the summer of 2003, and during this flap one strange account of a woman found in a Southern Ohio soybean field is under investigative consideration.  There is no certainty that this situation can be linked to the UFO or crop circle flap aside from the chronological and regional closeness, but the woman - who was hospitalized for a week after being found by a farmer - reportedly experienced amnesia and did not know how she got in the field. This matter is also held under close consideration by researcher Donnie Blessing and will be pursued further. This present case of &apos;screaming sounds&apos; from a female voice is linked firmly to the UFO sighting as per the same location in one specific field near Adams Lane in Morehead, Kentucky and the &apos;20 minute time frame&apos; of the conclusion of the UFO sighting to the arrival of officers involved in the search and rescue operation.

"Abduction from bed in 1968.I was alone in a room, lying on the bed listening to music and heard someone talking.  The voices slowly got louder and the music began to fade away.  Suddenly, everything went dark (the room was lit) and the next thing I knew I was in a &apos;room&apos; which I knew was a space ship, with two little aliens.  They were very kind.  I felt only love from them.  The air in the space was saffron colored and one wall to my left was filled with small lights and what looked like switches.  It looked a bit like a sound board.  They communicated with me telepathically and said that they wanted to see what effects Earth had on me.  At least that&apos;s what I heard.  Then, my body levitated to a horizontal position and under me there appeared to be a slab like table.  I closed my eyes and the next thing I Knew the music slowly began to come back.  I was not drinking or doing drugs.  :)   By the way Peter, I REALLY enjoyed listening to you tonight with Art Bell.  One of the best conversations I&apos;ve heard.  I apologize if this is not the kind of report you are interested in.  I would love to have a conversation with someone about this."
"I was 7 at the time of the sighting. I was riding my bike on our street when I looked at our house and noticed green smoke above our house. I told my cousin who was 6 and in the front yard. I went in the house and told my mother about it. I remember she was frying chicken and at first did not believe me but she finally came outside with me and saw the same thing. The smoke had almost all faded away when this object apeared out of nowhere above our house. It looked close enough you could have thrown a rock up at it and hit it. I assume we were looking up at the bottom of it, it was round and glowing like a full moon, the color was sort of a white or gray, it looked metalic. I remember there were several neighbors around  that saw it. My father came home and he saw it, I remember him saying &quot;come on down here&quot; and my mother telling him to shutup. It suddenly disapeared before our eyes, I don&apos;t think it vanished but it just moved away very fast. After it vanished the green smoke apeared again and then slowly faded away. It repeated this again later, maybe an hour, im not sure, my mother had called the police, but it had vanished again by the time they got there. She even called Keesler Air Force Base to see if there was any weather balloons out or anything and they said no. I remember later the same night the door bell started ringing rappidly and it was 2 teenage girls very scared saying that they had seen a ufo but it was not above our house like we had seen it was a little distance from them and they could see the side of it, I remember them saying it had blinking lights around the side, I dont remember what colors and they said it was moving and an airplane was moving toward it and it suddenly disapeared. Later after the girls left, we were looking up in the air in the front yard and we saw a a orange colored streak in the air above us but this looked a great distance in the air, high or higher than an airplane, the object making the streak was round and also looked orange and then it looked like it made a couple of small circles and the object got smaller and smaller and disapeared.The object never made a sound any of the times we saw it. I was only 7 at the time but it seemed like it was a couple days later when the Pascagoula ufo incident occured where the 2 men where abducted by aliens. I sometimes tell people what I saw, some believe me and others get a laugh out of it, but I don&apos;t get mad at them because if I hadn&apos;t seen it I might be sceptical about ufo&apos;s and life on other planets..((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))"
"I am reporting this as it has been a long time and has bothered me for quite some time.  I was about 7 or 8 at the time my parents and i were traveling home one night and when we were close to home my father noticed some lights in a field ahead of us. as we got closer we could see a very large craft hovering above a field. We stopped and my dad says i am getting out to get closer and i said im going with you dad. we walked toward the object and got within 50 feet of it it was huge. I would say it measured about 300 feet in length and height wise was about80 to 100 feet. It was saucer shaped with windows going all around the middle.  I remember looking up through the windows and the inside was just the purest white i have ever seen as far as lighting goes. the outside was pure silver and underneath was a light that glowed. then i noticed figures coming up to the windows.  I started to get frightened and walked back to the car and stood by the passenger side by my mom and it appeared as though she was frozen i tried talking to her but she said nothing. i said come on dad lets go and he never answered me just stood in one place staring. then it took off made no sound but i heard like a rush of air as it moved at an unbelievable amount of speed and disappeared.  Then we got back in the truck and drove to our house on elk lake. After getting home we went into our basement and looked out over the lake and witnessed the craft hovering in the same spot , it had red and green lights emulating from the bottom. I remember looking at the clock and seeing that it was 12:00 midnight excactly.  My dad said he was going back and i said i was tired and going to bed.  We never talked about it the next day and went about our business as though nothing ever happened. Within the last 8 years it has been increasingly been on my mind and now being 32 i am curious as to what happened that night. I asked my mom about it and she says that i was in the car the whole time.  Thinking about the time i dont think it was that late, i mean my parents usually had me home in bed by 9 or 10 at the latest all the time .  I have since have repeated nightmares of being taken and am not sure what is going on.  I haven&apos;t really told anyone about this other than a very few close friends and fiance.  I cant say for sure that i am a recipient of an abduction but i know what we saw that day and i believe we had some serious missing time.  I would like to go under hypnosis but am scared of what i may recover from that day.((NUFORC Note:  We have written the witness, requesting that his parents submit reports of their recollections, as well.  We will attempt to put him in touch with investigators, if he wishes to delve into the incident.  The date of the incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))"
"Circular craft, nighttime sighting, close range, red, green, yellow lights, probable abduction, missing timeI am reporting what happened to my boyfriend at the time, later my husband and father of my children.  We had been dating for about one year. I was 18 and he was 17.  He was coming out to my parents farm (2+ Mi. from town)to see me at around 9p.m..  He was driving a small Bridgestone motorcycle and was less than 1 mile out from town (where he lived, and almost to the Burlington Northern RR tracks when he sensed something above him.He looked up and a round craft was directly over him at around 100 ft. in the air.  It was not very large in size, completely circular, and had green lights, red lights and some yellowish lights on the bottom.  There seemed to be some sort of lines in the bottom, like spokes in a wheel look.  It was making a low humming sound that resonated. It was almost pitch dark so he couldn&apos;t see the color of the craft.He immediately tried to accelerate the bike to get away from it because he was absolutely terrified and realized that he was staying in one place in the road, even though the bike was still running and it seemed that the tires were still moving.  He had driven that road so many times throughout his life and knew every bump in it.  He realized later that during this initial few seconds that if he were still driving fast like he had been before seeing the craft he would have already been past the RR tracks. He remembered cranking the accelerater real hard and the bike didn&apos;t speed up.Then he doesn&apos;t remember anything AT ALL until suddenly he was back on his bike in almost the same spot, with the bike moving, only he was going real slow, like 25mph, instead of 65mph from before.  He proceeded to come to see me and never mentioned a thing to me or anyone else.From my vantage point, I was waiting at the farm and watching the clock, excited to see him and couldn&apos;t figure out why he was late.  He had called me right before he left town and should have been to my place in 5 minutes.  Instead he arrived in about 25-30 minutes later.  I asked him what took him so long and he acted really weird. I noticed that he looked pale and was quiet all nite.  In fact I noticed a change in his personality from then on but kept it to myself.Then, about a month or so after that when we were out on a date, we talked about going and parking at a radio tower near town where all our friends went (lover&apos;s lane kinda spot).  We had been there before.  So we went there and were sitting for a few minutes when he freaked our and said he had to leave the spot, then proceeded to tell me what had happened with the UFO. Before that he had made fun of me because I believed they existed. I know this isn&apos;t my story to tell. I also know that the experience impacted my life almost as much as his and I feel it is important to tell you about it. I don&apos;t remember the date or time, but gave a guess. I was and still am amazed at how terrified he was and remained so for many years.We are no longer married and as far as I know he refuses to talk about it. I think he pushed it out of his conscious mind. At the time, though, I told several friends and family members and he talked about it a couple of times to them, also.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))"
"Chrome colored object in western sky.Not sure if this is the right thing to do, but here it is.Ever since I witness this strange object on March 29th 2004, I have had many strange things happen. The evening was partly cloudy, and windy, and unusually warm, so I went outside to see the sunset and have a cigarette. While looking to the west at the sunset, I noticed a chrome ball in the sky, and I immediately dismissed it as an airplane coming towards me. After several minutes of watching this object, I decided to run in the house and get my video camera to film this, in case it was a UFO. After I came back out side, the object had moved to the north, but still hovering over what looked like the Oakland area. As I started filming the object, it swiftly maneuvered towards my location. As it passed me directly overhead, roughly the height of the high clouds, it disappeared. It made no noise as it went overhead, and I could then see the object was oval or roundish, about half the size of a large airliner. I went into the house and turned on the TV news and my radio, to listen if somebody else witnessed this. Nothing was reported on the stations I selected. As I listened to the news, I hooked up my video camera to the other TV to see the video, which I was expecting to remarkable. I rewound the tape, and pressed play, and nothing appeared but fuzz. Now I had goosebumps all over my body. Something happened to the tape. The entire tape was dead, just fuzz. Then I started thinking, maybe this thing knew I was taping it and that&rsquo;s why it flew overhead, but I still to this day cannot figure out why the whole tape is messed up. Here&rsquo;s where the fun begins. A day after this event (which has dramatically altered my life) I notice items in my patio missing. An old electric keyboard is gone, and so was my fishing equipment. I quickly dismissed this as a neighborhood kid theft, but then I started noticing other things missing too. My hair brush, my dirty laundry, my tooth brush, and even some old video tapes that I used to record my friends wedding the week before. I am the only person who lives here, except for my pet Doberman, who is very old, and semi-senile. The next part of this might freak you out, as it did to me, and to this day I am afraid to sleep. The following two nights after the sighting, I heard noises in my garage, which is adjacent to my bedroom. Through the walls, I head movement and rattling noises, and what sounded like voices, but squeaky. The third day after my sighting, I decided it was time to check on things in the garage, and swung open the large front door. All of the light bulbs had been removed, but other than that, everything seemed to be in order. Maybe kids? The doors were locked and remained locked, so I&rsquo;m unsure what it could have been. I have decided to move out and sell the house, as I am just too freaked out to stay there, and have been staying at a friends house for a while. i am now worried I might be abducted.If you need to discuss this or see the fuzzy tape feel free to email me. Thanks."
"4 objects converging into a formation crossed the night sky high above then shot off in 90 degree angle!!I&apos;m 33 yrs old, I&apos;m into astronomy and aviation. I live by a major airport and under a main approach for aircraft.  I&apos;ve seen everything from actual meteor&apos;s entering the atmopshere and breaking up, to the Stealth Fighter during an airshow.  I&apos;ve read a heck of alot about the UFO Phenomenon, but never have ever seen anything other than man made and natural occurances.  I met this girl who&apos;s also a UFO believer and has had some interesting dreams.  I had considered her to possibly be an abductee, as I have a few family members who have seen UFO&apos;s and whatnot in their lifetimes.  I however have been half skeptical because of all the time I&apos;ve spent looking at the stars.. Well .. tonight things changed.  My GF saw a light which I could not crossing the sky.  I figured she was seeing a satellite.  since my eyesight is not too great I figured she was telling the truth but I ribbed her saying she was nuts.  It was the first nice clear night for a major city where the magnitude is pretty horrible.  We went into the backyard, she sat on my lap and we spent some romantic moments looking at the stars.  I told her jokingly &quot;ask the star to come back&quot;. Within 3 mins another star started moving across the sky.. I had my binoculars ready and watched it .. thought wow! A satellite but it disapeared too early.  Thought that it was odd but probably fell out of the sunlight&apos;s reflection..  It had moved both from South to North across the Northern Cross.  Then again we saw a bright light move, compared to other stars a short distance.  it was like a star that was there.. then started moving slowly,  then moved fast then dissapeared again. I told her to send another wish up the aliens to confirm we saw something wierd as a joke to her again.  This time something beyond my wildest dreams happened.  I am still in shock at this moment.  So far I thought it was just satellites moving in a straight line.. I only saw 3.. she saw 4.. in the same area.. about 2 mins after she silently sent a message as I asked for a sign.. 3 lights reddish came out of nowhere right out of the southern side of the northern cross int eh same area we were seeing activity.. move across from the right (south) to the north at VERY high speed. 2 of the lights were converging .. it was like they were in formation getting closer.. then abrubtly turned at a 90 degree angle to the east and disapeared again.. My jaw hit the ground.  I&apos;ve seen video of ufo&apos;s many times and other things.. but always.. ALWAYS said I&apos;d never TRULY believe everything I&apos;ve read about until I&apos;ve seen it for myself.    After seeing so many military aircraft over the years and watching the stars all these years.. seeing bolides, shooting stars, and everything else.. I HAVE NEVER seen anything like this.  It totally blew my mind.. my GF and I were totally ecstatic.  We&apos;ve both wished to see something ALL of our lives to confirm our beliefs.. IT FINALLY HAPPENED!!! I am still pinching myself!!  I felt no need to get a camera it happened all within liek 5-10 mins between all the sightings. WOW!!! A lifelong wish fulfilled!!! That was nothig man made!!!"
"Got to get this off my chest. I&apos;m not the hysterical type, but what I saw while parked on the damn Wal-Mart parking lot (of all places) gave me the creeps. I&apos;m sitting and waiting in the car while the wife shops. I was just looking toward the front entrance of the store when a glint caught my eye. I thought I saw something bouncing around next to a passenger jet flying in low. (we&apos;re not far from BWI airport) I rubbed my eyes, because I figured I was seeing a glare or something. NOPE. Upon looking back up, there were now three shiny spheres- just circling and following the aircraft until it was almost out of sight. Then- another plane was coming in low and they were back! Unreal!! These things were NOT balloons or anything like that. I&apos;m not a drinker or a drug user and my eyesight is 20/20. It went on so long that my wife came walking out and I had time to show her. She freaked. She won&apos;t speak of it. Before they left, I asked a woman who was loading groceries if she saw what I saw. Her reaction was to turn and say &quot;Good Lord!!&quot;. She split in a hurry. Here&apos;s something strange: We can&apos;t for the life of us nail down the date we saw them. No, we weren&apos;t abducted! It&apos;s just weird.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD))"
"Driving in a thick pea soup fog. Car headlights went out suddenly. I had seen &quot;Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind&quot; a few years ago.  (therefore the date I gave above is only an estimate)  When the lights went out suddenly, I pulled to the right side of interstate 70.  I was headed south.  My 2 companions were go-go dancers.  I was taking them home. I stopped the car and thought that the senario reminded me of the aformentioned movie.  The fog was thick but when I looked to my right I saw a farm house  thousands of yards away that had a large red light above it.  It illuminated the whole area.  I thought at first it was a helicopter searching for some lost kids or something.  But the red light stayed fixed on the farmhouse.  I noticed there was no sound. The huge red light and no sound made me suspicious.  I tried to figure a a reasonable explanation for it, but could find none.  I kept thinking that the red light would move, but it didn&apos;t.  The light was so large, I reasoned, that it could not be a helicopter, either. ( I had not read any ufo books on abductions at this time.  Only later did I realize that what I saw appeared to be a classic abduction case.) After watching it for a half hour or more, I realized that this could be a UFO.  I raised my right hand,( in a form of greeting, with palm foreward) and said in my mind.  &quot;I have a son at home, please don&apos;t take me.&quot;  I felt immediately a tingling sensation on my palm, like they had heard my message.  I tried to awaken the two women in the back seat.  However, they did not wake up, no matter how I tried to make them.  I blieve I finally saw the light move some to my right, slowly. Still no sound.  After some time of watching the red light, I fell asleep.  I drove back home  hours later when it was light, as my lights still did not work.  I took the car to a repair shop and asked them pointedly about what caused my headlights to go out.  They said they did not know.  I had to have both headlights replaced.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))"
"Dull red giant &quot;bracelet&quot; at Santa Fe Baldy mountain,summer 1978, Pecos Wilderness, New MexicoI studied journalism, learning to answer who, what, when, where, why, how, how much, and how little for 3 college years. I&apos;m 60 now, but not a professionnal journalist. Now I&apos;m an artist. In probably July (or August) of 1978, I arrived on trail 254, I believe it was, at the base of Santa Fe Baldy mountain, in the Pecos Wilderness, just east of Santa Fe city, New Mexico. Checked my watch at midnight there, had walked in 4 miles, and here it began. I saw lots of fog upon leaving the tree covered part of the trail, especially to the West, or left of me. In this fog were small, perhaps 1/4 or 1/2 inch across, lights of a dull red color. They started out a foot or two off the ground, and went slowly straight up, to perhaps 4 or 5 feet, then arched over such as a flair gun would create, but I did not see anything like a flare gun. Some lights may have gone farther,up to 10 feet.. These lights moved slower than any rising anything I had ever seen. I could euphemistically say time slowed down for these rising lights. But this is only a description, not a claim of time slowing down. After watching this for a few minutes, I walked into the area where the lights were, which had ground brush and a few higher bushes, but the lights disappeared before I could reach them. They were spread out over 25 plus feet parallel to the trail, and launching at random intervals. I went back  to the trail and waited but no new lights appeared. So I walked further on the trail. There was considerable fog about, and I turned right to sit on a log and rest. After a while, I saw huge red lights, like balloons 100 feet across each. They were linked by a chain of the same dull red color and its intensity as the &quot;balloons&quot;, indeed as the &quot;flair&quot; lights now 50 feet back on the trail. This braclet configuration, was laid across the top of Santa Fe Baldy, as if a giant child had dropped it on the mountain, above its tree line (thus Santa Fe Baldy) so that the center of the bracelet was where the top of the montain was and the braclet&apos;s &quot;balloon&quot; fobs were perfectly horizontally surrounding the mountain a few hundred feet down from the top of the mountain. I estimated 2 or 3 such fobs would be behind the mountain, where I could see nothing. I saw either 5 or 7 that were partially or fully in view. This dull red color was consistent throughout both the fobs and the thin chain that linked them. I was stupefied and opened up a candy bar. There was no noise whatsoever, and I realized there was no 3 dimensional depth to any of the fobs. I took them to be spheres, nevertheless, rather than discs. The fog cleared a small amount and I was more sure of the sphere shapes. As I sat there some non-corporeal &quot;spirit&quot; type beings, two, one adult male and one apparently teen male,wearing white robes, sort of like the proverbial ghost,floated in from behind me on the left, a foot or so off the ground. I was used to that having extensively practiced mediumship (I become a human telephone between this world and the &quot;spirit world&quot; whether for departed humans or never incarnated intelligent beings) but this appearance was the last thing I expected in this event. The taller adult one telepathized to me: &quot;Too many doorways!&quot; So what? So what does that mean? Oh... I had been thinking of climbing up for a closer look. Had done it in the daylight before, and even that was rugged. He repeated the warning. Then the shorter, apparent teen (say 17 to 18 years old) said: yes, that I could actually get killed doing it. I thought nonesense, and was unmoved by them. The older one then kept repeating &quot;Too many doorways!&quot;  Too MANY doorways, I thought, what does MANY have to do with it? I thought about it for some time and pretended to agree not to make an effort to climb Santa Fe Baldy there that night. The spirits levitated back to where they came from behind me. I chuckled to myself &quot;Like Hell!&quot;  Daddy and Junior came back and Daddy yelled (telepathically): &quot;I said &apos;Too many doorways!&apos;.&quot; I was mad, but yielded. (Damn spirits, I thought, too holy to say more than a word or two. And god forbid there should be a discussion with them. Thank hell for important people! ((No, they weren&apos;t demons, just jerks.))  They left and I continued watching. Nothing changed. I saw no movement. I realized the fog probably obscured the dull red something from being seen at all down below some 3,000 feet in Santa Fe. I watched some more, got bored, remembered if this were a ufo something, its power system could be extremely dangerous, and so decided not to spend the night nearby. I walked away from the mountain for 2 miles and arrived at my reserved camp site at 2am, and the walk was hard because I felt very tired. I couldn&apos;t figure out why I should be so tired, and this walk seemed to take forever.  Then, when I got to Spirit Lake, on the near side, I had to walk through a group of 15 or so, late-high school or early college age kids, 2 or so of which were girls. They had no camping equipment, but 2 or 3 other young guys did. I went through them and followed the shore of the 50 yard-acrosss-lake to the far side.There I resolved to awake at 10am completely refreshed. I ate a bit, zonked out, and woke at 10 am &quot;completely refreshed.&quot; Only the kids with gear were on the far side of the lake, groggily rising. The 15 kids were nowhere and I guessed they were at a camp somewhere not too far away. I ate, packed up, and walked back the way I came, without incident, to the car six miles away. That&apos;s all, for that situation, at least. There&apos;s a lot more, best for another time, when I have more energy. I&apos;m 60 years old and this happened 28 years ago. Thank you for reading.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))((ADDENDUM FROM SAME WITNESS))Part 2 of seeing dull red light at Santa Fe Baldy mountain in July 1978.Part 2. I am the person reporting dull red light on Mountain Santa Fe Baldy. I am the journalism backgrounded writer. Loose ends for part one. in 1978, when this occurred,I didn&apos;s need, nor used any prescription, nor any hallucinogenics. As I said, the next morning I woke about 10am, very rested and refreshed, ate and headed back by the same route I came in the night before. No manifestation of the dull red light was anywhere. Everything was completely normal. The next night in Santa Fe, I saw the same dull red light, in the sky in the southern area of Santa Fe. This time it was a single light, going on and off like a plane might do. Due to the dull red color it appeared slightly fuzzy, and was heading south, slowly, like a light airplane might appear to move. Off and on for several nights, weeks, a few months such appeared in the night sky. In late 1978, I moved to Denver, CO. With some friends I went during the summer on an overnight backpacking trip in the mountains, about 100 miles west of Denver. That night I saw another one of the dull red lights flying in the sky. I stopped bothering to look for them. But, 20 years later, I saw a red light and heard a simultaneous sound of a light plane engine, for a few seconds. It was also dull, located just above the buildings east of the intersection of E. Evans and S. University, on the north side of E. Evans. I had just come from Chamberlain Observatory where I had viewed Saturn with their older but powerful telescope. There the astronomer lecturing for 45 minutes, started by telling people who wanted to talk about flying saucers to leave. A legitimate request, since it was his show, that of Denver University, and conventional science. Later, I viewed Saturn through the telescope. This viewing of a dull red light lasted 5 -10 seconds, and when it went behind the building from my viewpoint, the airplane engine noise also went away. Why all the continuation of this dull red light, starting in 1978 as on the land of the mountain, plus the &quot;flare gun&quot; effect, then appearing in the night sky like planes? Then the final light appearing and disappearing in the busy intersection at night?  Kind of every which way but loose. A saying in journalism is: Believe nothing of what you hear, and then only a tiny fraction of that. I&apos;m a long way from a conclusion of what I saw, UFO or not. Someone has a book in which he said Martians have a cave under Santa Fe Baldy where they live and do whatever, but I don&apos;t remember the author or specifics. And there&apos;s been some remote viewing, which is a close relative of the clairvoyance I have used at times. Because the continuity of the appearances of the dull red light in whatever shape, bracelet or single light in sky, I record this. The bracelet did not fly, of course. And I was certainly puzzled by the flat appearance of the bracelet&apos;s fobs, which could have been due to the fog present thickly at first, and thinner later on, but making a false visual of flatness, even though otherwise it &quot;should have&quot; been a sphere (each fob). Heard the saying &quot;You make your own karma.&quot;? This means whatever you do, you set in motion some of whatever happens next. Go to Santa Fe Baldy and use your wits. Also, this was in 1978. I haven&apos;t been back there since. I did not record these events at the time, that I recall. If I go back into researching these memorable events, I think I&apos;ll really want to seek out more current events. I do notice that I almost never, if at all, see accounts of dull red lights in UFO reports. Finally, there is more to this story than I have told, and I suspect it would take a small book to cover it all. I&apos;ve seen enough Science Fiction to help with scenarios which could illuminate these events, however indirectly. And I think there are multiple possibilities for the &quot;story&quot; of these dull red lights, including UFO source and non-UFO sources. And I had no direct reason to believe I was abducted in the 1978 or subsequent sightings of the &quot;something.&quot;  Thank you for reading this.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

"Returning home from an evening shopping trip my husband spotted several bright lights in the sky into the distance. Instead of continuing through the city to our home, he turned back and headed towards the lights, which made our journey home through the country roads. What we saw were about 8 and sometimes more very large round lights following the south side of Mine Rd. As we drove beside and watched them, trying to figure out what they were, we began to notice that some would suddenly go dark while another would light up nearby. They all stayed fairly close together and they continued their path directly beside us. We turned left on Landsdowne Rd and they also turned with us. Landsdowne Rd is several miles long, so we drove slow and observed.They stayed beside us. We had no preconceptions about UFO&apos;s, therefore we did not feel any threat from this, just curiosity. Suddenly a helicopter appeared in the sky on the north side of the road. When we heard the helicopter&apos;s engine and saw the small light in comparison, we realized that the lights that we had been following (or following us) made absolutly no sound. When we turned right on the next road my husband decided to keep past our development and go as far as the small airport to see if that was their destination. They continued beside us and on past the airport. This seemed to be a never ending journey and we were beginning to feel a little strange about it so we turned around back to our house, which was just a few blocks off the main road. We could still see them behind us and they seemed to be hovering. Once home, my son went to get his friend to tell him about this. They climbed on the garage to see if they could see them. The lights or whatever it was had crossed the road into a large unpopulated area next to our development. My son and his friend watched them hover in that area until they got tired and came in. Of course I had no fear then about abduction, etc. because I wasn&apos;t aware of such things. Today, I would not have taken it so lightly.The next day someone called into our local radio station and was talking about the lights and how none of the local military bases had anything like this in the air. I then knew that more people than my family had witnessed this. It was a very dark night so we couldn&apos;t determine if the lights were attached to one large craft or each was a seperate craft. I would love to know if anyone in this area recalls anything about this. I now wonder about the reason they stayed with my family.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))"
"Possible UFO- but more importantly, the alien experienceI can&apos;t be certain whether this was actually a UFO, because I live approximately 5 miles from the Airport.  We see and hear jets/planes/cessna&apos;s/helicopters everyday, all night long.  However, the odd thing about this craft was that, it was triangle shaped, and it had odd patterned lighting.  They were arranged to illuminate the craft, and the lights were all white.  Whereas, on the normal aircraft that we observe everyday, there are an array of colors like yellow, white, blue, etc.  Anyhow, the lights were not only arranged oddly, but they blinked and glowed in a very transe like manner.  They blinked so fast and in some sort of pattern, it really stood out like an oddity, nothing that we&apos;re accustomed to seeing.  I was on the balcony of our third floor apartment when i saw it, so I called out for my sister, and she came out and dismissed it as a plane.  But, I just had that &quot;odd&quot; feeling in my stomach.  Anyway, this hasn&apos;t been the first time for me to have these &quot;supernatural&quot; occurences. I believe I was visited by &quot;aliens&quot; one night while I was sleeping.  I woke up several times, paralyzed, and couldn&apos;t speak or move, but I was able to think clearly.  I could not see a clear figure, but I was very terrified and frightened and the being that was in front of my face was telling me to go back to sleep, and was putting something into my ear.  The second or third time that I awoke, I couldn&apos;t take it anymore, so I started praying telling the being that in &quot;Jesus Christ&apos;s name, to go away, and leave this room&quot;.  And it finally left me.  I did research and found out that there are a lot of people who&apos;ve had the same experiences as I, and there is a site that you can learn more at:  www.alienresistance.org  I Believe that all of these sitings and experiences are part of what Christians believe to be the &quot;Great Deception&quot;.  What this means is that Aliens are going to show themselves and try to get people to worship them. In reality these &quot;aliens&quot; or &quot;Gods from above&quot; are really demons.  Why do you think that every alien abduction or experience like mine is always so frightening and terrible?  &quot;Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the last days some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron.&quot;  1Timothy 4:1-2  &quot;For there shall arise false Christ&apos;s, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.&quot; Matthew 24:24((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

"Two silent perfect equilateral triangle craft observed for atleast 150 minutes at New Idria CA.I sat down for a rest(2300ft elevation) while hiking the hills on our property. It was early dusk with clear skies.Looking west I saw two bright white lights maybe two miles distant approaching at approx. 40 to 50 mph as they cleared nearby hills(3400&apos;) by about 200 to 300&apos;. At about 1/2 mile each light resolved itself into 3 smaller white lights located at the vertices of perfect equilateral triangles. The two craft kept approaching directly towards my position with the one on right side leading by 100ft and about 100ft separation to the other.  Both were absolutely silent and headed directly above me as they moved due east.  I watched intently when &quot;on a dime&quot; the lead craft suddenly stopped straight above me (at I guess anywhere from 700&apos; to 1200&apos; above). Looking straight up I saw the craft as a dull metallic triangles against the blue sky--I can&apos;t recall much else right then except maybe a central circular feature and the fact the other craft had proceeded east over a hill. I became increasingly nervous as it sat perched directly above. After about 30 seconds I panicked and ran down the hill (1 minute) to my truck parked in workyard.  Looking up it was still there and the other one was slowly rejoining it from the east. I jumped in truck and drove it across New Idria Road and up my driveway to my home (about 90 seconds), to find out that both craft were still just hovering there (in echelon as before). So I watched them in their silence. After a few minutes one of them headed slowly east over the hill again and minutes later returned again.  I went for my camera (35mm) to find no film--highly peeing me off-and I had no one to call (nearest neighbor 6 miles north).   returned outside to watch more of the same action (silent hovering with one and then the other every 5 to 10 minutes smoothly tracking east and then returning-in a sinister manner I recall thinking}.  I think I found binoculars but could not hold them steady to any advantage. I flipped them (the craft) off in my angst but quickly &quot;apoligized&quot; and started making arm motions &apos;to come on down&apos; and sit a spell--to no avail. It got dark and yet they were still there. I pulled out my flashlite to signal--it did not work nor did any others I could find (not unusual but I can&apos;t say I checked later to ascertain their real status). In the dark I could see and remember the white lights at the vertices. At one point I got a stiff neck and went in for a sandwich. Back outside--still there.  An hour or so after dark they finally glided off slowly(at max. 15 mph) in tandem due east.  It seems it was 10:30 pm or so then. They made me feel uneasy and it&apos;s strange but I cannot recall telling anyone about it (except maybe one friend-who can&apos;t recall) which just wasn&apos;t and isn&apos;t like me.  And I might have even forgotten all of this but for the fact that a year and two weeks later I had another sighting which I will report (here in NUFORC database) as September 12 of 1992. It was this later sighting that seemed to trigger my recall of this one. Both sightings were absolutely real but leave me very perplexed (esp as to not telling folks and even not recalling this sighting). I have no recollections of being abducted (though I&apos;m curious enough to want to try hypnosis) and it seems certain that this first sighting began a recurring &apos;nightmare&apos; of not being able to find light switches in dimly lit dreams of mine. Other details: My best estimate of craft size is 40 to 60&apos; on a side. Dull metallic silver hulls. Some sort of circular configuration maybe 10&apos; diameter at center of the belly of the triangles. Would have reported this long ago but just became aware of this website after Jenning&apos;s special. Want to thank website creators very much and would appreciate knowing of similiar sightings, especially one&apos;s around same time and within 200-300 miles of central California.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  One of two reports from same witness.  PD))"
"I WAS ABDUCTED INTO AN AIRCRAFT AND USED FOR EXPERIMENTS BY UNKNOWN BEINGS.I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK AND AS I DROVE ONTO THE FARM TO MARKET RD  I SUDDENLY SAW A BEAUTIFUL WHITE/OPAL AIRCRAFT. IT HAD A CURVING NEON PURPLE TAIL THAT TOUCHED THE GROUND. I HAD JUST PHONED HOME AND TOLD MY FAMILY I WAS ON MY WAY AND I LOOKED AT THE CLOCK BECAUSE WE WERE SUPPOSE TO MEET AT MY HOME AND GO OUT TO DINNER FOR MY HUSBAND&apos;S BIRTHDAY.AT EXACTLY 7:30 PM I LOOKED AT THE CLOCK. SUDDENLY IT FELT LIKE I WAS BEING SUCKED OUT OF MY CAR BY SOME POWER THAT WAS COMING FROM THAT AIRCRAFT. IT DID A REALLY STRANGE THING. FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON I PARKED MY CAR ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND LOCKED THE DOORS.THE NEXT THING I REMEMBER I WAS GETTING BACK INTO MY CAR AND IT WAS APPROX. 8:30 PM. I HAD A SPLITTING HEADACHE AND MY EYES FELT LIKE THEY WERE BURNING FROM THE EXPOSURE TO THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF THE AIRCRAFT AND INSIDE THE AIRCRAFT.AT THAT MOMENT I KNEW I HAD BEEN ABDUCTED AND TAKEN INSIDE THE CRAFT.WHEN I ARRIVED HOME I TOLD MY FAMILY WHAT HAD HAPPENED. THEY ACTED AS IF THEY DIDN&apos;T TAKE THIS SERIOUS.AT THE RESTAURANT I SAW A VOLUNTEER FIREMAN AND I ASK HIM IF HE HAD HEARD OF ANY UNUSUAL THINGS IN THE SKY. I CALLED THE SHERIFF&apos;S DEPT. AND THEY SAID THEY HAD HAD  NO SUCH REPORTS. AS TIME WENT ON I BEGAN TO REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED TO ME. I REMEMBER BEING INSIDE A ALMOST COMPLETELY STEEL ROOM.IT LOOKED VERY STERILE.IT HAD LOTS AND LOTS OF CABINETS AND AN EXAM TALE IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM.I REMEMBER TWO MALE FIGURES WITH OBLONG WHITE HEADS AND BIG EYES. THEY WERE PROBING MY BODY AS IF THEY WERE TAKING BLOOD AND BODY SAMPLES FROM ME. I COULD NOT MOVE, I JUST LAID QUIETLY ON THE TABLE. IT WAS ALMOST LIKE I WAS AN EXPERIMENT. THEY NEVER TALKED TO ME THEY JUST LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND WROTE STUFF DOWN. I REMEMBER THE MORE DOMINANT MAN DID THE WRITING WITH HIS RIGHT HAND. I TRIED TO MOVE BUT IT WAS LIKE MY BODY HAD BEEN GIVEN SOMETHING TO MAKE IT HELPLESS.I DON&apos;T REMEMBER HOW I GOT INTO THE CRAFT OR HOW I GOT DOWN. I JUST REMEMBER THIS PULLING FORCE THAT PULLED ME TOWARD THE CRAFT.I TELL PEOPLE AND THEY LAUGH AT ME. I HAD NOT BEEN DRINKING OR TAKING ANY TYPE OF DRUGS OR MEDICATION THAT WOULD CAUSE ME TO HULLICINATE. I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO ME AND I OFTEN WONDER WHO THEY WERE? WILL THEY BE BACK FOR ME? WHAT PURPOSE DID I FULFILL IN THEIR EXPERIMENT ON THE HUMAN BEING? THESE QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED. BUT I KNOW I WAS ABDUCTED INTO THE AIRCRAFT AND I WAS RELEASED."
"Small Gold Flat Chip(s) Extracted From MouthHere&apos;s a play by play of exactly what has transpired. I&apos;m an American living in Brazil with my girlfriend of 5 years. About three months ago I was driving back with her from the town where she grew up in Brazil. We were conversing, passing time, and she happened to tell me this story about how she and her sister used to expell metal pieces out of their mouths when they were kids. I was nodding my head and acknowledging her, but inside my head my thoughts could frankly be described as, &apos;mmhmm, oky doky&apos;, like &apos;yeah, sure, I&apos;ll just forget my girlfriend ever mentioned this crazy story&apos;. She continued to say that her mother had the last piece extracted analyzed in a lab and the results were that the object was not &quot;from this world&quot;. I naturally probed with a few questions, but I wasn&apos;t convinced so I honestly let the story in one ear and out the other because the mother or sister wasn&apos;t there to back the story and I need proof to believe something like this. Friday August 4th, 2005 - The Proof  My girlfriend decides to come home for lunch, a rare occasion. I made her a sandwhich, she ate, then had to rush back to the hospital (she&apos;s a doctor). She went into the bathroom to brush her teeth and I remained on the couch with our dog. All of the sudden she came out holding her finger out at me with a gold piece on it and said, &quot;Remember when I told you me and my sister were getting these metal pieces out of our mouths? Well, here&apos;s one&quot; (very calmly and confidently). She came out and showed me this thing like this wasn&apos;t the first time she&apos;s shown someone else these objects and she handed it to me and told me to keep it. She also had this air about her like, &quot;You believe me now?&quot;. So I inspected it. I was really curious. I asked her if it had come off her necklace and she said, &quot;C&apos;mon (my name), no&quot;. Then I made her swear on my grandmother&apos;s soul that she wasn&apos;t lying and she did. My grandparents who are diseased mean the world to me and she knows it. Then I started thinking, was it in the bread, egg, salt, onion, tomato, cheese, ketchup, or lettuce that I made her? Was it in the grape juice she drank? How about the toothpaste? So I went into the bathroom and pointed out the toothpaste tube we&apos;d been using and asked her if this was the toothpaste she&apos;d used and she confirmed it was the one. So I squeazed the remains out on the bathroom counter and mushed it around with my finger to see if there were any more chips, no chips. Then she left, she had to get back. I got curious having this thing in my possession and wanted to check online to see if anyone else has had this same strange phenomenon happening to them. I wasn&apos;t having any luck. I started putting in on Yahoo, &quot;coughing up metal&quot;, etc. I was clicking around with no luck until I happened upon this website, reading this story. http://www.ufoinfo.com/filer/2000/ff_0003.shtml  &quot;STRANGE GOLD IMPLANT FOUND Bill Bean writes that, &quot;In July of 1997, I became mysteriously ill and couldn&apos;t swallow, because there was a pressure on my throat.&quot; I felt I was choking, just drinking water. It was the most horrible experience of my life, and I wish it on no one. I saw eight different doctors and many tests were done and nobody gave me an answers. I was rushed by ambulance to the hospital, three times in three weeks. I truly thought I was dying. I noticed a pattern of red circular marks on my back that I felt was a reaction to the medication. My wife photographed them. I could not eat and my weight went from a muscular 240 lbs. to 198 lbs. On December 16, 1997, I was in the bathroom with my wife, brushing my teeth when felt a bristle came off my toothbrush causing me to cough. I reached in my mouth to get the object with my right index finger and found a gold - square - flat - chip. Our first thoughts were that it had to come out of the toothbrush. Something told me to save it and I did. The next night, while brushing my teeth, I started coughing again and expelled two more of these things in the sink. After expelling the first piece, I felt like some pressure had come off of my throat and the next night a lot of pressure had come off. I began eating normally and felt much better. Last year, I sent one piece to Derrel Sims who had the object analyzed. Bill says, &quot;My piece matches a piece that was surgically removed from a person four years ago in Brazil. An isotopic test to determine if the piece is alien is being accomplished.&quot; Thanks to Bill Bean bllin@erols.com. Editors Note: Derrel Sims and I feel this may be the most significant implant case thus far. derrel@holman.net&quot;   When I read that line, &quot;On December 16, 1997, I was in the bathroom with my wife, brushing my teeth when felt a bristle came off my toothbrush causing me to cough. I reached in my mouth to get the object with my right index finger and found a gold - square - flat - chip.&quot;, a surge of fear shot right through me. I felt like I was in a movie suddenly or a bad dream. How could this all be some weird coincidence? It&apos;s possible sure, but I have a hard time formulating a hypothesis. Is some company having a food processing flaw allowing 20 some odd chips to fall into vats over the years and these three people in different countries happen to consume?   There are so many possibilities! Could it be the government somehow tracking people? Why the two sisters? Why the man, if he&apos;s telling the truth? Could extraterrestrials be abducting and experimenting on us? My girlfriend, seems to think they are coming from her nasal passage, not travelling up her esophagous and surfacing in the throat. Or perhaps if it is a food consumption flaw perhaps it&apos;s getting caught in the back of the throat in the tonsuls or skin. In 2002 after she extracted a chip, she moved with me shortly after to the US in 2003. Coincidently, she had a bad nasal infection and smell emminating from her nose.  Another oddity related to this: both sisters have a benign cyst in the same location in the cerebellum in their brains. My girlfriend two months ago was feeling immense migraines and motor skill loss, so we went a diagnostics center here in Brazil to have an MRI done. I saw her holding up the large X-Ray looking sheets into the light and she said, &quot;Weird, I have the same cyst as my sister and in the same spot&quot;.  Immediately after I read that similar story online, what did I rashly do in a panic? I called SETI. I got their secretary in California and she couldn&apos;t help me, all she said was that she was sorry, but she didn&apos;t know where to guide me in this appologetic voice. Then she advised me that my girlfriend should see a doctor. I told her, &quot;the person who is expelling these is a doctor&quot;. And she didn&apos;t have anything to say, but that she didn&apos;t know how to help me.  That&apos;s when I started emailing as many UFO researchers as I could. Everyone seemed to refer me to A.J. Gaevard here in Brazil. So I contacted Mr. Gaevard and he was very nice and helpful and directed me to someone here close to home. What I do know is that when the mother of the two sisters had the piece in 2002 analyzed, from what I gather, they basically took it, said it was not from this planet, and didn&apos;t give it back and the family didn&apos;t hear anything back. So the girls weren&apos;t extracting anymore chips and the issue subsided and nobody talked about it, until now. I had my girlfriend call her mother in front of me and ask what happened exactly to the last chip. So her mother called her contact and this is what her mother explained to my girlfriend, who explained to me: The first lab didn&apos;t know what it was or what it was made of, so they sent it to another lab where they said it was somehow composed of quartz. That&apos;s it. And it took three years later for the mother to find this out in 2005. Update: We have since remained in contact with A.J. Gevaerd and his close friend and colleague who is an esteemed doctor and publisher, which we met in person last Monday (8/29/05) to drop the chip off for analysis. They are conducting research on the piece now. Results will be posted in Gevaerd&apos;s magazine sometime in the near future.((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with this witness, and have seen photos of the tiny, gold-colored object.  At this time, we have no specific reason to suspect that the object may be of extra-terrestrial origin.  It is being analyzed, under the direction of Mr. A. J. Gevaerd, well-known UFO investigator, and publisher, from Brazil.  PD))"
"Illuminated cylindrical craft hovers slowly and silently over residences.....It was a late August night.  The sky had a violet hue to it.  That is how, despite the night fall, I was able to discern the shape of the craft in question.  My mother, my grandmother, younger brother and I were parked in our Dodge Ram Charger waiting for my father to get out of Foodland.  My father had been working a number of years as a butcher in their meat department.  Our station wagon was in the shop at the time so, we used the Ram Charger to run errands during the day and were forced to pick my father up from work each night until our car was repaired.  The Foodland was located on Campbell Rd. where it intersects with 14 mile rd.  The Foodland no longer exists.  There is a large grocery store in it&apos;s place now, and an Outback Steakhouse restaraunt in the parking lot where we witnessed the bizarre aircraft.  We were parked facing the west side of Campbell Rd, waiting patiently for my father to get out of work.  He was scheduled to work until 8 pm that night and that&apos;s exactly when we saw it.  Some bright lights began shining through the treeline above the residences along Campbell Rd.  The lights were very low and they were intensely bright.  Although none of us said a word, I later found out that my grandmother and mother had both assumed, as I had, that the lights belonged to a low flying passenger jet.  Eventually the ascending object came into view above the treeline.  All of us were silent for a moment.  At first, we stared at the object in silence, each one of us trying to determine WHAT it was we were all looking at.  When no conclusion could be reached, my mother exclaimed &quot;Oh my God!&quot; and we all got out of the Ram Charger for a clearer view of the strange craft.  By the time I had gotten out of the Ramcharger, the aircraft was no longer ascending.  It remained completely still for about 45 seconds and then slowly, very slowly began hovering southbound along the west side of Campbell Rd.  The object appeared to be about 4 to 5 homeyard lengths, though it is impossible for me to judge exactly what our distance was.  From my perspective, it spanned the distance of about 5 of the front lawns of the residential homes it seemed to be hovering above.  The object was shaped like a relatively thin cylinder.  The perimeter of the craft was lined with rectangular lights of extraordinary brightness.  There were very thin slits dividing the lights that were the same shade as the rest of the exterior of the craft: black(or at least how it appeared as a silouhette against the violet sky).  The lights did not move along the perimeter of the vehicle.  They did however look like they were bound by a textured or coagulated transparent surface.  Those lights were the most incredible display of illumination I have ever witnessed.  I could not see any specific details along the exterior of the craft.  Under the lighting conditions, it appeared to be a flat black or at least a very dark brown.  Although I must admit, there was the hum of Campbell rd. and 14 mile rd. traffic from our position, the hovering object made no sound that could be distinguished from the passing cars.  It left no kind of trail in it&apos;s wake either.  After about 4 minutes watching the aircraft hover slowly and silently south along Campbell rd, my mother became frightened and began yelling for me to get back in the Ram Charger.  She later told me that she had begun thinking of all of those horrible U.F.O abduction stories she&apos;d heard about and seen on various t.v shows.  At that point, I could only see about one third of the craft anyways.  It had hovered nearly out of sight behind some of the much taller trees.  I obeyed my mother and got back in the truck.  We all waited with inpatience for my father to exit Foodland.  When he got to the vehicle about 5 minutes later, we were all frantically telling him to get in the car and try to spot once more what we had already seen.  My father laughed at first.  He didn&apos;t seem to believe our story at all but after a few moments of him observing our enthusiasm over what we had witnessed, he hopped in the truck and started off down Campbell.  The flying vehicle had not been lost from our sight for more than 6 minutes and yet, as we drove further and further south down Campbell, we found that it was no longer visible in any direction.  Even at major intersections such as 13 and 12 mile, where we looked back to see if the object was flying too close to the trees to be seen from the road itself, we ended up seeing nothing.  It was gone that quick.  As far as I know, no one ever reported sighting the object to the police or any other agencies in that area.  I checked several newspapers the following morning to see if anyone else had shared our bizarre experience.  Given the size, illumination and altitude of the hovering vehicle, it seems completely impossible to me that we were the only people to have witnessed this.  Even as I was glaring at the airborn object, I found it hard to believe that traffic along 14 mile and Campbell didn&apos;t come to a complete standstill when this thing came into view.  Save for the indifference of surrounding citizens, it looked like an incredible effects shot of an extra terrestrial visitor in a blockbuster film like &quot;Independance Day&quot;.  I have never seen this craft again and I also have never seen it photographed or even sketched once during all the time I&apos;ve spent reviewing popular U.F.O sighting since.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

"GIANT UFO - Natick, MA on Route 9 behind CAR WASH - either 1977 or 1978.Hello. I SWEAR on my life and in the name of God that what I have typed below is true, and it did happen to me, my mother, and my brother. I figured it must have been in the fall of 1977 or the spring of 1978, as I was in 3rd grade, and there were no leaves on the trees, and was warm out. My mother was driving down Route 9 in Natick, 9pm-ish at night, and we saw what looked like a round shaped stationary flashing of Christmas lights hovering about 1000 feet above a Car Wash about a mile down the highway.....  My brother who is 3 years older than me was also with us in the car (my mom was driving the 1970 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser Station Wagon).  I was in the back seat, my brother and mother were in the front seat. WELL, me being 8 to 9 years old at the time, I knew that this was no hot air balloon, nor a blimp, nor a giant kits with lights.  There is not a night that goes by without me thinking of that night.  IT was the SIZE OF A LARGE HOUSE !!!!!!!!!  As my mom continued down Rt. 9 near the car wash, It dropped out of the sky unlike any aircraft could ever do.......and there were the most colorful lights/beams rotating everywhere flashing from this round house sized thing......... lights all over it (I don&apos;t recall seeing any beams).............it made NO noise.......it hovered over our car, then it was following us........also, every dog could be heard howling and barking in the neighborhood.........it&apos;s almost impossible to describe.............and it was hovering right over the car with us in it.....it was at the tree tops, following us...  as mom was driving, she lost sight of it, and so did my brother......and I was in the back seat, terrified...looking all over the place for it as it couldn&apos;t just dissapear like that.......and then I looked up through the tinted moon-roof window of the car (the 1970 Oldsmobile Station Wagon) and I yelled &quot;it is right on top of us!!!  and it&apos;s getting lower!!  It&apos;s following us!!!&quot;  It was right over the car, and then the lights on this thing started going even more crazy....once again, it was the size of a LARGE house, and round with all colors of lights - mostly on the outside what I can only make sense was the rime of the UFO.  Underneath the UFO it was solid, as even though it made no noise, I could hear it hovering over us, as sounds were bouncing off of it.....   The only way I can explain that I knew it was solid, is to close your eyes, then have someone walk by you.... you can hear a solid mass blocking sound.  Does that make any sense??   Every dog in hearing distance could be heard braking like crazy in the neighborhood my mom was driving (behind the car wash in Natick, Massachusetts).  I never knew so many people owned dogs.....  People were coming out of their houses, and I remember so clearly a woman coming out of her house, looking up above our car, and her screaming for her kids to get back in the house at the top of her lungs.....door slammed, and her outside lights turned off.  THis lady was obviously terrified.  As my mom drove around the neighborhood, and this giant silent lit up christmas tree appeared to get even lower below the trees.  My mom knew a lady who she did typing work for in the neighborhood, and my mom pulled the car into her tiny driveway....  we got out of the car (I don&apos;t remember seeing my brother get out of the car or not, but I do remember my mom with me against the car.) .........and when Mom stopped the car in someone&apos;s drive way (whom she knew and did typing work for), the house sized sphere with rotating lights on the outside rim of it, and some lights flashing underneath it was something I could not make sense of..... being ony 8 or 9 years old, the only thing I could associate it with was flashing christmas lights in ALL colors...BUT, the lights were not apearing to flash/blink on and off......it was as if the lights were all joined together, making it look like the giant house sized silent object that was hovering or spinning over our car......but the lights I believe is what made it look like it was spinning as that is the only rational explanation I know.I swear on my grave, and on my life, that the house sized object looked like it lowered below the trees, almost in an arms reach.  My mom then told me to climb up on top of the car and see if I could touch it.  I climbed up onto the hood, then with one foot on the windshield of the car, I reached up my arm (I don&apos;t remember which arm), but I reached my arm up to see if I could touch it.  For that moment we had no fear of it, and the terror was gone.  I was unable to touch it, and it was higher above the car than we thought it looked like.My mom, still to the day feels so guilty as she will sometimes say to me these days &quot;Why on earth did I ever tell you to see if you could touch it....Gahlleee&quot;   &quot;We didn&apos;t know if it was good or bad&quot;  she still says today.So, now that we are in this lady&apos;s driveway, parked.......My mom ran up to the lady&apos;s front door knocking like crazy....and when she came to the door my mom said to her &quot;You have to come out here !!   You have a UFO in your front yard !!!&quot;  So the lady walked out to her front steps and looked right at it, and calmy said &quot;hmmmm....  oh yes&quot;..........    Then she calmly proceeded to ask my mother how she was.  I was stunned with this lady&apos;s reaction.  My mom (still to the day) says that the woman was in a trance when she came out of her house, making very light of the GIANT ROUND house sized light show that was drifting off into her back yard, and into the woods of Natick where it faded behind the trees in the forest.Then, I realized what I just did.  I was on my mom&apos;s car trying to touch this huge thing !!   I got off the car, my mom made some light conversation with the lady, and we got the heck out of there, back home to Wayland.  That was when the real terror started to set in of what happened.  We got home, my mom reached for the phone and said &quot;Who do I call!!!  I can&apos;t call the police!!!&quot;..... so my mom called my sister who was newly married in Marlboro, MASS.     I was terrified for months when it got dark.  There is NOT one night that goes by that I don&apos;t look to the sky, waiting for it to show itself to me again. The whole UFO incident from start to finish lasted about 5 to 10 minutes.  I have recently discussed our experience with my mom, and she said that she will drive the same exact route with me in the day time, and I&apos;m going to film it with my digital camera as Mom tells the story - remember that my Mom was the driver, and her being the only adult in the car, she noticed other things that my brother &amp; I didn&apos;t. Now, you can understand why I think of this thing every night...always looking into the sky at night, almost waiting as if the giant lit-up round freek show thing is going to come back some day or night.   My brother still doesn&apos;t like talking about it to anyone else besides me or Mom... What ever it was, it sure it wasn&apos;t there to greet us as friends, or to let us know that it would not harm us......or to bring peace.....but there was only that brief moment of fascination when I climbed up onto the car to see if I could touch it..... I was absolutely terrified when I went to bed that night, and was for many nights after that waiting for it to appear in the back yard and come back for us in Wayland - the next town over.  Remember that I was 8 or 9 years old....... It just ticks me off as I will always wonder what the whole point of this giant airship hovering over us in the car was for....   ya know?   Ok, so we saw this huge floating round UFO with colorful lights.  What did it want?  What, did it want to put on a show for us??  What was the point it wanted to make??  These a questions that have bugged me for the last 30 years, and I am finally coming out with my experience..   No, we weren&apos;t abducted, none of that stuff...... no physical contact. Maybe if it were evil, I shouldn&apos;t want to know what it wanted, and why it was there that night, floating down to our car.  I remember being so mad at school when telling my friends the next day of what happened.......then they would tell me that it was probably a hot air balloon..or a blimp.....that I shouldn&apos;t lie................that was when I stopped talking about it...  Well, I have seen a blimp, I have seen hot air balloons in all shapes and sizes, and this was NO BLIMP or HOT AIR BALLOON. I understand I am not allowed to reveal my identity or contact info in this forum, and if I were allowed to, I would take my chance and give out my name and email to see if there are others out there that experienced what we did back in the late 1970&apos;s in Natick, MA.......as we have NEVER reported this UFO before, and this forum is the very first time this UFO that we experienced is being shared to the world.  I just want to talk to someone else that saw what we did that night. Nailing down the exact date is difficult, but I do remember I was in 3rd grade, born in 1969, so it had to be 1978 or so......  I do remember that there were little or no leaves on the trees, and it was warm outside....and very dark. Agian, I swear on my life in the name of God that what I have typed above is true, and it did happen to me, my mother, and my brother.  Follow-ups, PLEASE....   Thank You. - D."
"Abducted, studied, scared.Well, I was going to bed, and I felt like I was being watched, then, I saw a Bright, Green Light in the sky. It was swirvy, and from the botom, cam a bright red light, then I almost idmeatdiatly fell into a deep sleep. I had a dream, and a figure was telling me not to be scared, and that i would be in extreme pain for a moment, and I woke up, on the floor, with neck pain like i was going to die and five scars on my hand (supposedly from a blackedned hand, but i never noticed thesae scars before).((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

"I saw a real something in the sky. Clear as a bell and very interestingThe object was round. It looked as if it was spinning. Silver with flashes of light. Like a ball of spinning mercury. It was hovering over the house on the next rural block. Silent! It was a clear wonderfull morning. The background was the mountains so it shown very clear. This area is well known for activity. It is not the first time I have witnessed activity, but, the most disturbing. This sounds strange, but it noticed me. I noticed it. I felt a bit of mental presure. Sounds crazy I know. I was not scared, just concerned. The object was there for at least 5 min. I had time to call my partner and tell him. At one point it looked as if it was heading my way. This is when I felt the mental presure. My partner yelled at me to get the camera. My dogs had been unusually quiet untill now. All 10 started to howl (I have an informal dog rescue and no we are not trashy people). This is the point it started to head west into the mountains slowly. I went to get the camera and by the time I got it running, the object was gone. This is stranger. I started to get confused soon after this. I had to stop and center myself. I felt strange. I am a person who is never a victim of life, but I started to get confused and a bit forgetfull, like I wanted to, a bit of mental time slipage? I called my best friend. We talked. I felt fine. I then laid down for a nap with my dogs. I am o.k. I did not lose any time, but I did feel affected. I refuse to let them take me from the light. In retrospect. I think it was doing something over there. Something happened or an exchange took place, something not very nice. My gut is never wrong. I went over to talk to the neighbors. They refused to talk to me. This is rural desert, so that behavior is not unexpected. This is an area next to Goat Mountain and Giant Rock. The Integratron is not far away and 29 Palms Base is right to the east. The unusual weather, paranormal, and sightings are not uncommon during the year I have been here. I have personally talked to people who have been &quot;abducted&quot; in this area. We also see a lot of orbs as of late. I have been told we will have a quake soon by oldtimers. But, that is an other story. While I have the stage. I believe something big is going on. That is for sure. To all my friends out there. Hold yourself in the light (I am a Quaker). Center your self. I know people who have been very affected by events such as this and worse. This is our life, our world. Some call it prayer. Whatever, just empower your self. Do not be scared. Bad things are happening, also good too. You are not crazy. Do not be a victim. Best of luck. Please forgive any grammer and spelling mistakes. Thank you, DM"
"Shape of object: Upside down stainless steal circular bowl Size of bowl: 12 - 15 inches in diameter Lasars: 3 inch diameter lasar beam was illuminated from the bottom of the craft shining down to the ground.Lasar Color: White Object on Ground: approximately 3 ft curled up rubber or snake like object  Unique Characteristic of Sighting: The bowl was upside down, hanging by a black 3 inch diameter solid material, it was hanging from a power line in an intersection. Unique Characteristic of Sighting: The traffic lights were normally extremely bright on my drive home from work. This particular evening, I noticed the traffic lights were extremely dim.  Description of the sighting: It was a clear night on my way home from work. I had driven this route every night for the last several months. The traffic lights always illuminated up the area and you could see it for a couple miles. I noticed in the distance the traffic lights at the intersection where I turned left were extremely dim on this night. At first I assumed there must be something wrong with the lights. I figured maybe some sort of construction was going on. Anyway, as I approached the intersection I saw this bowl like object hanging from a 3 inch diameter cable looking connection device shining a 3 inch diameter lasar on the ground. I came to a complete stop just under the lasar so as to put the lasar right outside my driver window. I looked on the ground to see there was a rubber looking 1 inch diameter 3 feet long snake looking thing in the lasar beam. I looked back up and saw the under side of the bowl. It was solid black with the exception for the 3 inch diameter beam shining down. I started to put my hand out to see if I could determine its temperature and immediatley got nervous and turned left and stopped to car. I got out of the car to examine the device more closely from outside my car and it was suddely gone. I didn&apos;t hear any sound. I didn&apos;t see it fly away. Of course, after I drove underneath and turned left I was in the car and it was to my back for about 20 seconds. I figured it took off while my back was turned. I didn&apos;t experience any loss of time. I didn&apos;t experience any abduction. It was simply hanging there and appeared to cause the traffic lights to go dim. It was only 12 to 15 inches in diameter. It was hanging from the power lines shining a 3 inch diameter beam onto the approximatlely 3 foot snake like object. And when it disappeared, the traffic lights were back to full illumination. The long rubber like object or snake like object was gone too. Everything was normal and no sign of the object.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))"
"5:30 AM PAPERGIRL WITNESSES HUGE, SILENT, GRAY, LOW OBJECT OVER HOUSE TOP ROOFS ON CITY ST.I AM NOT SURE OF THE EXACT DATE, I REMEMBER HOWEVER, WEARING A JACKET, SO I&apos;M THINKING IT WAS EITHER LATE SPRING, OR EARLY FALL OF 1984.  I WAS ABOUT 13 OR IF IT OCCURED IN FALL I WOULD HAVE  BEEN 14 YEARS OLD, WHEN AT APPOX 5:30 AM IN AUBURN, NY ON SEYMOUR ST, I WAS DELIVERING THE MORNING NEWSPAPERS.  IT WAS STILL DARK.  AS I WAS WALKING UP THE SIDEWALK, I HAD THE STRANGE SENSASTION AS IF I WAS BEING WATCHED, SO I LOOKED UP, AND I SAW THIS HUGE TRIANGLE SHAPED OBJECT HOVERING OVER THE HOUSE TOP ROOFS, IT WAS SO LOW, THAT I SWORE I COULD TOUCH IT, THEIR WAS NO SOUND AT ALL.  I REMEMBER STOPPING TO STARE AT IT FOR ABOUT 10 SECONDS I WATCHED IT.  I SAW A RED PULSATING LIGHT IN THE CORNER, AND VERY INTRICATE PIPING ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE WING.I KEPT THINKING THAT THIS IS NOT AN AIRPLANE, I WASN&apos;T SURE WHAT IT WAS.  I WAS JUST IN AWE, I LOOKED AWAY AND THEN LOOKED BACK AND IT WAS GONE. THEIR WAS NO TRACE OF IT ANYWHERE. BUT HERE IS WHAT&apos;S WEIRD, BECAUSE, I NORMALLY FINISHED MY PAPER ROUYTE AT ABOUT 7:00 AM , SO THAT I COULD GO HOME AND GET READY FOR SCHOOL, TO CATCH THE BUS, HOWEVER THAT MORNING I WAS 30 MINUTES LATE, AND I REMEMBER RUNNING, AND NOT BEING ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHY I WAS SO LATE, AS I WAS APPROACHING THE STREET TO HEAD HOME I LOOKED OFF INTO THE EASTERN SKY AND I SAW A HUGE GLOWING ORANGE SUN, LIKE NO SUN I HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE, OR  HAVE EVER SEEN SINCE.  EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT MORNING HAS NEVER FELT NORMAL TO ME, WHENEVER I REMEMBER IT I ALWAYS WANT TO IMAGINE THAT I WAS IMAGINING IT, BUT I CAN&apos;T BECAUSE IT WAS SO REAL. I RUSHED HOME TO TELL MY PARENT&apos;S WHAT HAD HAPPENED, AND THEY OF COURSE THEY DIDN&apos;T BELIEVE ME, THEY SAID I HAD AN OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION. SO, THE REASON I AM WRITING 22 YEARS LATER IS BECAUSE, I RECENTLY WATCHED A PROGRAM ABOUT ALIEN ABDUCTIONS, IN WHICH THE VICTIMS HAD DESCRIBED THE SAME THING I WITNESSED, DURING THE SAME YEAR, AND CLOSE TO WHERE I WITNESSED THE SAME THING. I THOUGHT ALL THESE YEARS THAT MAYBE I DID IMAGINE THIS THING, BUT NOW THAT I SEE SIMILIAR REPORTS I AM STARTING TO THINK IT REALLY DID HAPPEN.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

"10/15/89 Bright fast moving light over valley west of Glennallen, AlaskaExtreme bright light moving East to South West across a wide valley.  This was AFTER is was right behind my parked car.  I was driving back to Anchorage, it was late, and I parked in a rest area about 25 miles from Glennallen, Alaska.  No houses or buildings for several miles from the rest or pull off area.A large tractor trailer truck, that had not been there when I pulled into the rest area, was there after the bright light (which gave off a loud humming noise) shot off toward the South West.  I had gotton out of the car to try to figure out what was going on.I was very suprised to see the truck.  I didn&apos;t hear it come into the rest area, and it was parked 20-30 feet from the front of my Audi sedan.  I ran to the driver&apos;s door on the truck. The driver just looked at me and said something like you see things out here at night that no one would believe, or words to the effect.  I was pretty excitited at the time.This happened 18 years ago.  I had no idea who to tell it to or report it to until seeing something about the National UFO Reporting Center on TV last night on the History Channel.  Also, I was concerned about saying anything to anyone other than my wife as it could have effected my professional life.I did not see what looked like a craft.  The light was so bright and it moved so fast I was simply stunned.  The humming noise was very loud.  I can only descpribe is a &quot;electrical&quot; in nature.  No other way to describe the sound other than the volume.I believe there is more to this.  However, in an effort to keep from sounding like I&apos;m crazy I will leave this report as is.  It was the strangest experience of my life.  I do not drink or do drugs.  Never have.  It would be possible for someone to think I was under the influance after giving the full details of the incident.  I don&apos;t believe I was abducted.  However, the truck and driver and electrical problems (which cured themselves) with the car would tend to make it look like I was abducted or came close.To this day I have no idea what happened.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

"The truth behind the Grays  This is a recounting of an abduction experience I&apos;ve hade about 6 years ago. Nobody knows about it, or the other countless abductions I&apos;ve had for as long back as I remember. The first time I remember there being quiet bright lights in the sky above the back yard. I felt this strong urge to go outside and check it out. and when I did, they took me. And they&apos;ve been taking me ever since. SOmetimes they&apos;d come for me, other times they called me and I would have no choice but to them. I did tell my parents about it once, as a little kid, around 6 years old, when the Greys left me in my living room insted of dropping me back in my bedroom. They blamed it on sci-fi movies and videogames and I got yelled at for making up stories. That was the only time I tried to tell anyone. When I moved from home into my appartment, I slept with a 9mm. under my pillow for months, but I was always paralised when they would come for me, so that idea was a bust. Setting up video cameras in my bedroom proved ineffective as well. In the morning, the tapes would be blank, like I never set them to record at all. And after a while, the fear dissapeared from the abductions and I started to accept that getting pulled out of my room on random nights was just something I&apos;d have to deal with. One night in July of 2001, I was abducted. It seemed business as usual. I was called to the room of my appartment and then the flash filled my eyes, and when it cleared, I was laying on the table again. The grays usually planted dozens of accupuncture type needles in my chest, stomach, neck. Rarely they would insert a tube into my ear or throat which was quite painful. This time was the tube in my throat. As the machine was being prepared, several of the grays seemed to rushin from another room. They spoke to the ones about to experiment on me, and they all ran from the room. I felt a rumble in the table I was laying on and heard a loud explosion, followed by what seemed to be weapons fire. Several minuets passed and then a tall, armored figure wearing a blank faced mask entered the room, carrying a type of weapon, resembeling an assault rifle. The figure removed the mask to reveal a very canine like face, with bright orange eyes, covered by short, blue fur. The usual abduction experience was frightening, but seeing this new creature made me feel like my heart would beat out of my chest. The being leaned over the instrument table the grays kept their tools on and began touching the objects there. Suddenly I could move again. The creature came over to me and gently helped me into a sitting position on the table. Then, in plane English, asked if I was alright. I told her(I say &apos;her&apos; because the voice of the being sounded most definitely female to me) yes and asked what was happening. I rose from the table, and she led me from the exam room. outside the room, in the large halls of the ship, there were dead bodies of grays around every corner. Creatures like her, and several other new strange creatures were at control panles and moving about the ship. The creature introduced herself at this point as Boudica(boo-dee-ca) and told me that this ship was going to be destroyed. I asked her why and what was going on. She then exlained to me something I never thought of in all the time I was being abducted: The grays, in reality were a cybernetic lifeform created by Boudica&apos;s race and more than 3 dozen other races in contact with each other on the other side of the Milky Way. Centuries ago, they formed a union with each other to establish trade, travle and the discovery of new lifeforms across the universe. However, space travle was a long, difficult affair. So these large, strong alien races created the small, weak looning grays as sort of advanced scouts, used to seek out, examine and greet new intelegent lifeforms as they found it. They gray body design was chosen because the alien union thought that body shape the least threatening. They in general being tall and muscular, they couldn&apos;t see the gray body type being a threat to anyone. As I proceded through the ship, I noticed gray bodis being carried through the hall, some in peices. And sure enough, in the open wounds of the grays there were servos, wires and components I could not identify in my limited experience. Boudica took me to a room filled with several other large aliens. One alien, an 8 foot tall being who appeared to have a reptilian face with a feathery red crest around its head, asked how long they grays had been taking me. I told him(?) the last 15 years and he apoligised to me for all the pain and trouble I&apos;ve been through. Then he promised me I&apos;d never have to go through any of that again. Boudica told me I&apos;d have to be put to sleep to be transported back to my appartment, because they didn&apos;t fully understand the methods the grays used to teleport people from place to place. She took a long rod like instrument from the control panle and waved it once in front of my face. That is the last I remembered from the gray ship. It has been more than 6 years since I&apos;ve been abducted. I&apos;ve tried to make sense of the events on the gray&apos;s ship tha night. As far as I can figure, they grays were supposed to be a scouting party to survey newly discovered intelegent races in secret. For whatever reason, they failed their mission, and would not stop abducting people and experimenting on them. So, the ALien union who created them is now in the process of finding and destroying them. It is my beliefe that whe the Ailen union finally destroys the threat to Earth posed by the grays, then they might finally make their existence known to humanity and induct us into their collection of races across the universe.

"Triangular, quiet, extremely slow-moving craft sighted around Charleston, SC.Today, July 24, 2007, I was reading through articles posted on www.fark.com.  One of the links was to a UK Daily Mail article titled &ldquo;UFO sighting bring town to a standstill&rdquo; (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=470579&amp;in_page_id=1770), about a UFO sighting over Stratford-Upon-Avon.  What immediately struck me in the article was the picture at the top, which made me think &quot;I&apos;ve seen this before.&quot;  A friend and I once witnessed a very similar triangular aircraft flying around the area of Charleston, SC, in summer 2004.  This drove me to look into how many others have seen what I saw.  I figured I&rsquo;d find one or two stories, not the hundreds that can be found that describe the same thing that I remember.I don&apos;t believe in encounters with aliens or anything like that; I think it&apos;s obvious the distances across space are far too great for such a thing to happen.  Despite that, or perhaps because of that, this event had struck me as being very strange, and has left a strong memory of what I would usually dismiss as someone &ldquo;seeing things&rdquo;.I&apos;m not sure the exact month when it happened.  It was during the summer of &apos;04.  A friend and I who were going to school at the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command in Goose Creek, SC, decided to go out and get some late night Waffle House.  My friend was doing the driving, as I don&apos;t have a license.  Perhaps if I drove more I&apos;d remember the exact locations better, but I don&apos;t.  You don&rsquo;t remember driving directions well when you don&rsquo;t drive.  Looking at the area&apos;s Waffle House locations on Google Earth, I figure it was most likely the one on Goose Creek Blvd, or perhaps the one on Aviation Rd near the Charleston Airport, which is also very close to the Charleston Air Force Base.Well, we ate our Waffle House.  Afterwards, we figured we had time to waste.  It was probably a Friday or Saturday night or something.  We didn&rsquo;t know the area well as we were only there a short time for the school, and our spare time was usually spent within the city of Charleston.  So, we went exploring.We weren&apos;t more than 5 miles away from one of those two Waffle Houses.  We took a turn onto a long, straight, wide, smooth road.  It seemed to be a strange road.  I know I&apos;d never seen it during the day.  There was a little traffic on the road we came off of, but none on this one.  It was wide, 6 lanes if I remember right.  It looked like it was freshly paved.  The street we came off of was in the open, but this one had the forest close in on both sides, I&apos;d estimate within 10ft of the road.  The trees were tall on both sides, probably 20-30ft, or a little higher.  It would give me the impression of a planted forest since they were all about the same height, but you can&apos;t really tell at night.  We couldn&apos;t see the end of the road in sight, the road in front of us was the only break in the trees, for the whole length of the road.  No other roads turned off that we ever saw.  The street was completely unlit, except for our truck&apos;s headlights.  I don&rsquo;t remember if there were any markings or signs at the intersection that stated the purpose of the road.  There were no signs whatsoever during the length (a couple miles) of the road.  The road turned out to end in a military base, which makes the lack of identification of the road confusing, though it explains it&rsquo;s otherwise spartan appearance.We were driving down the road no more than a minute, when my friend pointed out some lights above the trees to the left.  I can&apos;t remember if there were 3 or 4 lights when we first saw it.  There were definitely 3 white lights (not &apos;glows&apos; as I&apos;ve read some people as seeing) at the 3 points of the triangle.  We slowed down the truck to about 5-10mph so we could get a better look at it.  It quickly became clear that what we were looking at was no commonplace aircraft.I remember trying to determine if I could see a shape of the aircraft, and vaguely thinking I saw a darker (black against the midnight blue sky) shape against the sky.  It had reminded me of a nacho chip, with a light at each of it&rsquo;s points.Next I noticed how slow it seemed to be moving.  It gave me the impression of being low-flying and extremely slow.  (I can&rsquo;t understand how people are claiming that these flying triangles they see are at 1000ft and going 30 knots, etc.  How can you tell from the ground at what height it is, and how large it is?  You can&rsquo;t really tell if it&rsquo;s 170ft wide and 100ft off the ground, or a mile wide and 50 miles off the ground.  At least I couldn&rsquo;t tell in the dark of that night&hellip;)  It made me think of something like a B-2, but if it was only 170ft wide, or however wide they are, then it must have been almost unmoving.  I know few aircraft we have can hover, and a B-2 sure ain&rsquo;t one of them.Then my friend pointed out something that should have been far more obvious &ndash; it was very quiet, perhaps silent.  We couldn&rsquo;t hear any discernible sound over his little Toyota truck.  This later made us think that it could have been a much larger craft higher up, but that seems less likely.  While an extremely large craft could appear to be moving slowly and be silent if it were orbiting the Earth in our upper atmosphere at high speeds, the idea of some Independence Day-sized aircraft remaining undetected by everyone on the planet seems unlikely, not to mention the absurdity of such a design.The next part is still what strikes me as the strangest.  It reminded me of the old stories and movies of a beam of light coming out of a flying saucer to abduct people.  In the center of the craft there was what appeared to be a searchlight, one of those directional beams of light used to illuminate specific parts of a landscape.  I don&rsquo;t remember the light first turning on specifically, and I don&rsquo;t remember it being there when we first saw the craft.  The reason I stated that there were 3 or 4 lights at the start is I figure if it had the searchlight on from the start I would have noticed it a lot quicker, but the clear image planted in my brain is that of the flying triangle with the 3 lights, and the one searchlight in the center.  It was being directed around apparently randomly, like you&rsquo;d see one being used in a prison escape movie to search for an escapee.  The beam could be seen moving quickly and erratically, but smoothly, over the forest, and it occasionally passed over the road we were on, as well, but it never really got close to the truck.  We were still moving slowly down the road with our truck, and the craft was still passing slowly above us.  I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking at that time that whatever piece of magnificent technology that had to be, that they must have known we were there.  But if it did know we were there, it didn&rsquo;t give any indication of it.We kept looking at it in awe as we crept down the road, it eventually being above us and to the left, so that my friend was sticking his head out the driver&rsquo;s side window, and I was looking straight up at the dashboard.  It slowly passed us, or we passed it; whatever happened, it was behind us.  Not much farther down the road we spotted the trees straight ahead that marked the end of the road.  The road split off to the right side, and I think to the left as well.  I remember the right side more clearly for some reason.  There was an empty guardhouse to the right of a small 2-lane road, which had 2 or 3 large yellow-painted pylons staggered along the lanes to keep anyone from flying through.  I&rsquo;d swear I remember a sign to the right side of that road, on the side of the guardhouse, which declared it as an Army something-or-another.  It didn&rsquo;t seem strange to me at the time, but my searching indicates no army bases in the area.  Not even abandoned ones, which would explain the empty guardhouse.Well, we turned the truck around and started heading back, about 30-40 seconds after passing the aircraft.  The aircraft was gone.  Just like that.  We heard no sound that indicated any type of engine speeding up, or any aerodynamic noise, or anything.  It was just gone.We talked about it as we drove back to our Navy base.  We figured it was some sort of experimental military craft.  All the branches of the military were represented in Charleston, except for the Army, as far as we could tell&hellip; except for that sign that I still remember seeing.  We joked that we&rsquo;d probably be assassinated in our sleep by the CIA for seeing something we weren&rsquo;t supposed to.  It still doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me why they would fly such a craft over a populated area we were in.  Admitted the exact place was a thick forest, civilization wasn&rsquo;t very far away.That had remained sitting in the back of my mind &ndash; the time I saw that crazy experimental military aircraft &ndash; until I read that article today.  It didn&rsquo;t make sense to me.  The picture I see there looks just like what I saw, through from a lot farther away, but it&rsquo;s in the UK.  Why would experimental US military aircraft be flown in across the ocean?  They could be participating in it, but that doesn&rsquo;t make sense.  It&rsquo;s the American policy to share our old technologies, not our new ones.  Not to mention, the searchlight?  What was that?  With such advanced technology, it seems like a pretty archaic means of trying to find things at night, and not a very stealthy one.  I don&rsquo;t think we even use beams of light any more for weapons targeting, and we&rsquo;ve got much better ways of communications than using lights.  Makes no sense to me, but it was there.  Oh, and unlike those stories, it was definitely a clear, white light, like the 3 at the corners, except that it was a directed beam as opposed to a simple light.  It definitely wasn&rsquo;t red.I place this event as taking less than four minutes, though I can&apos;t really tell for sure.  It&apos;s not like I was counting the time on my watch.  My best guess was it was 1:30am.Well, that&rsquo;s all the story I have.  I&rsquo;m no UFO expert, or even a military aircraft expert, but I know what I saw wasn&rsquo;t anything the government will admit to having at their disposal.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

i believe i was abducted almost directly in front of my home.I was walking down the street to my home when i was a boy and all of the sudden a bright light hit me and i froze and the next thing i remember was that i was terrified running as fast as i could to my home though it seemed farther than where i was before when i got home my mother yelled at me that i was two hours late. Upon later inspection (i was in the shower) i noticed that i had a new scar of a triad of dots in the shape of a triangle in my armpit the whole event has been surpressed in my memory until recently i started to have dreams about the things that may have happened to me during those two hours. among those memories or dreams is distinctly tall and petite figures/sillouettes standing all around me in a bright and cold room. this is the first ive ever spoken this to anyone and I am a very skeptical person by nature but what happened that night is beyond anything that I have seen in this world.
"As a child saw lights in the woods and had an encounter with being  I was born in April of 1968 and I think I was about 4-5 upon this happening.  I lived in Oxford, Michigan and for an unknown reason I woke in the middle of the night, I do not know the time, however I was drawn to the window.  I looked out the window and saw a very bright light land in the gravel pit behind my house.  I figure it was about a mile out&hellip; Once the bright light landed it did illuminate enough to see a glow in the woods. (Just beyond the dig section of the pit).  I honestly cannot remember how I was drawn, but I was drawn outside.  If I had to guess, I would say it was a &quot;sound&quot; or frequency that drew me outdoors.  I remember knowing I was not supposed to be out of bed let alone outside, but was heavily drawn. Upon entering the backyard, I was greeted by a Being.  It was slightly taller than me with a long neck, oversized head and large oval shaped eyes, long fingers and toes.  The feet were bear, but honestly do not recall clothing.  The overall color of the skin was grey/green.  When I came upon it, it took my hand and we proceeded across the yard to the back fence.  Once I passed the fence into the woods heading out.. I do not recall a thing.  But what I do remember is a feeling of warmth, friendliness and curiosity on both our parts.  I felt no fear and felt hugely curious.  I remember that my feet felt cool and damp and I remember very clearly the sounds of the night, and the feel of the warm yet slightly cool damp air.  There was very little breeze.  It must have been mid to late summer. I had not thought of that night until I was around 15 or 16 years old when my mother and I went into a book store and I saw the book Communion for the first time.  I started hyperventilating and feeling dizzy and week in the knees as the memory flooded back.  The major difference in looks is that the &quot;grey&quot; on the cover of Communion is a sinister looking being, when my experience was much different. I petty much put the whole thing out of my head and avoided anything regarding Alien abductions, whether it was books or movies for years.  I now feel so far removed from the experience that I am comfortable relating it.  I don&rsquo;t know what it means or if anything happened or even if it really happened.  Was it possible it was a dream?  I did once talk to a hypnotist when I was in my early 20&rsquo;s and described my memory to her.  She was a Stop Smoking therapist and did Abduction Hypnotherapy also.  She indicated that based on her experience, my details were too heavy and too much physical memory for it to be just a dream.  She wanted very much for me to follow up with her, but I never did. I have done very little research, as I was checking out sites on the web I came across you site and decided to throw the information out there and see what came back.  Perhaps this is the time for me to do further investigation on this and determine if it were real or not.  I see that in 1966 there were a number of sightings in Michigan.  However that was years before my time. So here is your information.  Do with it what you will.  If it ties into other types of reports, perhaps this will be of benefit.  If not, I know that nothing will come from this report.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))"
"UFO lights over Minnesota River in Burnsville that resemble the Phoenix lights.I am a female and I&apos;m 26 years old.  My brother who is the other witness is 19 years old.  I have seen UFO&apos;s before, but nothing like this.  It was about 7:15pm, the sun was down, but it was still a little light out. I was driving back home on 35W with my brother and I noticed a bright light in the sky. I&apos;m so used to seeing jets and airplanes around here, I know what they look like in the sky, but this light was much different. Well as we were getting closer to home I noticed another light, then a couple seconds later another one appeared and I noticed they all formed a weird triangle formation. Well trees got in the way and I couldn&apos;t see the UFO&apos;s any more. Well about ten minutes later my jaw just dropped to the floor, because I saw five lights all spaced out equally and they were in a slight V-shape formation. Right away I thought of the Phoenix Lights, because I do remember what they looked liked. Now I knew these had to be UFO&apos;s and I got all excited. I told my brother to look and I told him that there is no way that those are jets, because they were too close together. My brother was just as amazed as I was and he wanted to take some pictures, so we took our exit and went straight to this service road that brought us closer to the lights. We pulled in a parking lot since it was uphill and we could get a better view. I noticed two other lights as I pulled into the parking lot but they were not part of the formation. We got out of my car and I took a couple pictures with my cellphone. We were facing north and we could see Downtown Minneapolis from where we were.  The UFO&apos;s were hovering above or at least along the banks of the Minnesota River, it was hard to tell. The whole formation was about a mile across. That&apos;s my best guest. I noticed that there was one UFO that was brighter than the rest and it was right in the middle. The color was a very bright golden-white.  I could see three seperate lights from that UFO, but the lights were so bright it looked like one. The rest of the UF! O&apos;s were n&apos;t as bright as this one, but they were of the same color. The UFO&apos;s didn&apos;t move forward or backwards. They just stayed there for five minutes or so and then they moved up or down, but just a little bit. We watched them for about 20mins and the formation changed a couple of times. Then all of a sudden one UFO that was on end of the right side moved out of formation and was moving slowly toward us. On this UFO I could see that it also had about three lights. I almost thought it was a airplane because of it&apos;s size, but then the lights weren&apos;t flashing and it looked like a boomerang? My brother got scared thinking that we were going to get abducted by this UFO and he wanted me to drive out of there. We got back in the car and I drove back home. I wanted to go back there and take better pictures with my digital camera. We only live five minutes from the parking lot, so I figured we would have some time to see them again. I got the camera and we went back to the parking lot. Sure enough they were still there! The time was around 8pm and there were just four lights. Now the brightest of the UFO&apos;s, the one in the middle drifted off and did it&apos;s own thing for a minute or so and then it went back to the middle again. I used my camera to take some pictures, but it came out crappy. I also video taped it, but that didn&apos;t come out as nice either. After I felt I couldn&apos;t get any good pictures from where we were, I decided to drive closer. I went back to 35W going north and as I was crossing the Minnesota River I looked to my right and I could see the UFO that was once in the middle of the formation, the really bright UFO I mentioned before. Since I was closer to the UFO I could see that the color of the light was a super bright white, the brightest light I have ever seen in my life. The best way I can describe the brightness is that it was like stadium lights. It also was hovering very low near the river. To me it looked like it was searching for something, because it was so low. I later heard from my mom that some t! ime in t he afternoon some people around the Twin Cities reported a metallic or flaming ball in the sky and some reported hearing a loud boom. My other brother has told me that some UFO&apos;s appear during or after a meteor?? If anyone is interested in my story or would like to help me figure out how I could get my video and or pictures in better quality, please contact me! Thanks! P.S. The two pictures have not been messed with and they are small in size since I took them with my cell phone and as for the video, I used my digital camera. I hope to at least get the video in better quality.  P.S. The whole UFO event lasted about an hour and a half.  From about 7:15pm to 8:45pm."
"Low flying object with light shining down on road , apparently a helicopter which made no noticeable noise.I was driving across Kansas on my way to California. It was late at night and i had just left a truck stop where i had a cup of coffee.About 100 yards off the road to my left there was what appeared to be an accident where someone had rolled over out in the field. There was what appeared to be emergency vehicles there with what looked like a floodlight on the vehicle.  I didn&apos;t stop because there was no need to with what seemed to be emergency vehicles attending. Actually the whole scene seemed surreal.As i continued down the two lane highway, I remember listening to Art Bell on coast to coast radio and there was a show on that was sort of a take off on that 1948 radio show with Orson Welles and &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;. I remember that on the show, there were alien spacecraft landing around the United States. I remember being momentarily sort of alarmed as i was listening to the broadcast.A couple of minutes later, I noticed a light ahead of me shining down on the road and coming towards me.  I assumed that the light was from a medivac helicopter going to the rollover accident to evacuate injured people.As the light shining down on the road approached and flew over my vehicle I noticed that there was no noise coming from the object which was at a very low altitude (i&apos;d guess no more than 100 ft or so).  I remember how strange it was that a helicopter could be flying that low and make no noticeable noise.  I remember looking in my rear view mirror and saying to myself, what the &quot;F&quot; was that thing.Basically,  I forgot about the whole incident until a couple of years ago when I was talking to my son about UFO&apos;s while we were having dinner at an Applebee&apos;s Restaurant.  Suddenly I just remembered the incident.... as if it was a dream though, and not something that actually took place.He talked to a friend of his who said that I probably had been abducted by a ufo and that they planted the false memories of the accident and the coast to coast show to mask the incident to me. Personally, i don&apos;t really know. The whole thing still seems pretty surreal as if it happened but it didn&apos;t happen.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

"abduction.was home from college for the weekend and went out to get my dog from its pen when i saw a bright greenish light in my woods, went and got my dog and then went to investigate. remeber approaching the light and seeing a outline of a craft of somesort, was quite large, hard to tell what kind of shape. my dog began to bark and i was all of a sudden paralyzed and fell to my knees. 4 figures around 7ft. tall came towards me and took me around my arms and took me in the green light. i would tell you more but so much happened it would be hard to type and explane it all.THIS IS NOT A HOAX, if you feel like you want to discuss this futher, please contact me.((NUFORC Note:  Probable hoax, we suspect.

"Multiple red llights in a row sighted  from my home in Antioch , Calif.On New Years Eve night me and three other friends went outside at midnight to bring in the New Year. We had some confetti we were trying to throw into the air and after I heard alot of fireworks go off in the distance.  That caught my attention to look to the left of me and I saw four reddish orange circular lights appear out of no where.  I told everyone else to look up to the left as well and we all saw the same thing.   We couldn&apos;t figure out what it was.  They were all four in a row .  Then all of the suddne a fifth one entered from the left side of the formation.  They stayed there for what seemed about five minutes then they all just disapeared at the same time into the dark like magic they were gone!!  It was quite strange.  Never had we seen anything like this.  However there have been quite a few sightings of other things in this general area of Antioch, Pittsburg , and Oakley, Calif.  A few friends of my family have actually had a UFO hover over them in their cars .  That was really strange as well.  They were so shook up they thought for sure they were going to be abducted.  Lots of real life stories out here.  I have had alot of ghosts in my houses out this way as well.  The police said they have even seen them and have had so many calls about strange things happening  in their homes.  My last home that a sold at least five more families have moved into it just to move out again.  I know why !!!"
Abduction  My wife and I had fallen asleep on the sofa bed in our living room. I woke up and looked at the vcr which read 2:41. There was an odd buzzing noize and a strange light pattern on the cieling above us. I heard scuffling sounds in the kitchen behind my head and became intensely afraid. Just as I was about to investigate three distinct figures with huge heads and small bodies &quot;glided&quot; into the room. The room was dark but I could plainly see that they were not human! There is light from the street that comes in enough to where i can make out a face. These things were wearing dark coveralls that ere tight and showed off skinny bodies. They also wore msaks of some kind and all i could see as far as thier faces went was thier huge black eyes surrounded by patches of light skin in the eye slits of the masks. Thier beltlines were about level with the bed so i guees they are about 4&apos; tall. I was NOT asleep or dreaming! I was immediately terrified out of my mind and tried to scream but could not even move. It was as if a nightmare was coming true. Supe-sureal as the people who witnessed 9-11 must have felt as the planes hit or towers came down. One stood at the foot of the bed and the other two were on my side. Mywife stayed asleep. they were making strange noises as if breathing through ventilators. Ialso heard mechanical sounds. Almost immediately I was lifted into the air afoot or two as if by magic. I could still feel the skin of my wife&apos;s shoulder under my hand and the blanket on top of us as well as open space and cool air below. I sensed movement all around and the room seemed to wobble and spatially distort. I tried to kick at them but could notmove so I tried to lean from side to side in the air. I calledout mentally for God and the Lord Jesus Christ to save me and instantly I was back on the bed and the beings and strange glow was gone. The Lord saved me from those things. It was not as if I was set down or just woke up. It was as if one moment I was up in the air and the next moment I was down. I didn&apos;t even blink! They were gone! I know that this was no dreamas it seemed real and the memory hasn&apos;t faded one bit as dreams do. i woke up my wife in a panic but did notwant to scare her so I let her fall beck asleep without telling her until the next day. Besides Iknew that Jesus would not let them return. I remember that at least 20 minutes had passed but do not remember the time it was over exactly. I only remember less than a few minutes of it.Praise God!!! This is not the first time.
"2 girls lose track of time while singing &quot;Octopus&apos;s Garden&quot; and taking a short cut through the woods around a pond after seeing a UFO!On our travels away from my home to my friend&apos;s house, we cut through some wooded areas that concealed a barbed wire fence enclosing a compound called Remington Arms. We had done this hundreds of times before, just like all the kids did, but this time we had become frightened while passing through the first woods because of an orange glow which seemed to be illumunating behind some trees in the compound. It was a dry humid summer night, but it smelled strange, like rain or some wierd sweet odor.We started to sing the Beatle&apos;s song:&quot;Octopus&apos;Garden&quot; over &amp; over again as we entered the second section of the dark wooded area. Brushing sounds of branches made us so nervous!  Soon we were at the clearing around the pond and could see the open sky.  We sang a bit louder and tried our best to ignore the orangey glow behind the trees.  I remember that the moon was hanging low and to keep our spirits light we slowly walked along the path toward it and kept on singing.  An object seemed to fly out from inside the Remington Arms compound and we noticed the strange odor in the air again. That wierd sweet odor, but even creepier was the way the tree tops were swaying, especially because there was no wind!  When we had first entered the pond area it felt as if something had been following us from behind the other side of the fence.  My friend was scared and I was too, but acted a bit braver and told her to keep singing and so our voices got louder with nervousness.  As we got closer to the shore of the pond we could see the sky better across the open water. Suddenly we noticed that it was a triangular shaped ship which appeared without any sound, except for the movement of tree branches brushing together as it emerged from behind some tree tops. The dark triangle cruised directly towards us. It had some bright orange lights and made everything look like a negative film, with that orangey, brown tone. We kept singing, but softer as we couln&apos;t believe our eyes. Was this truly a UFO? Time seemed to stand still and must have slipped away because when we finally were able to move away and go down the path, skipping rocks in the strange glow which illuminated our way out of the woods and into the streets, the moon had risen and looked smaller.We hurried to her house as fast as we could and upon arrival everyone was worried. We were three hours late. It was after 11:00 pm and we started out from my house at around 8:00 pm. It was less than a thirty minute walk even with our dilly-dallying!  No-one believed our story and said we each shared an over active imagination. We cried and begged to be believed. &quot;Call the authorities! We&apos;re telling the truth.&quot; and continued to insist that our experience was real! Then the next day my friend&apos;s Dad said, &quot;Maybe, girls, what you witnessed was only a new aircraft of sometype that the government was testing out. Make sure you both keep away from that area because you&apos;ll be caught and convicted of tresspassing!&quot; Of course, we didn&apos;t heed him and went back the next day afterschool. We sang until our lungs turned blue, but no UFO appeared. Later, after supper at my friends house, she decided to only walk me halfway home, the pond would be the &quot;good-bye&quot; point. So we sat on rocks in the clearing and began singing Octopus&apos; Garden again. Sure enough, the orangey glow hoovered over the moving tree branches and the UFO softly floated above the water once again, not making any sound. This time we were both frozen with fear and disbelief. Again time slipped by, my friend wore a watch, but when we checked it later, it had stopped. She admitted that maybe she forgot to wind it or push the pin in tight enough after setting it. Whatever happened we&apos;ll never know? We ran down the path not even skipping the rocks properly. With soaking sneakers and drenched bell-botttoms, we reached the streetlights and fell to our knees in the middle of the road and began to pray! The older kids in the neighborhood started to make fun of us when we told our tale, so we stopped sharing it! One boy who had a tree house  and lived near the pond told everyone that it was true and that he saw the same UFO! We sorta felt better and became closer than ever before. Eventually,though, we kinda stopped talking about it altogether. Soon we became more interested in teenage things, like love, Rock N Roll, and our developing figures. I was always on the skinny side, butd suddenly started to loose a lot of weight. The boy and my best friend fell in love. Soon after my parents moved to the country, I was hospitalized. The Doctors diagnosed me with Hodgekin&apos;s Lymphoma. But the pathology report said some nodes had bizarre changes in them which couldn&apos;t be identified! Radiation &amp; Chemotherapy took over my young life. I was just turning sixteen. I lost touch with ALL my childhood friends. The last time we got together was in 1984 after our dear friend, who said he also saw the UFO, committed suicide. My best friend was newly engaged to be married, but suspected that she was barren inside, maybe because of our experience. I haven&apos;t seen or spoke to her since.However,I was able to give birth to twin girls in 1986 and in March of 96 or 1997 during the visit of Hale-Bopp Comet, I had bizarre dreams of being abducted and woke up with tiny needle marks on the veins in my right hand. My daughters both had nightmares! One of them saw me on a table in a white room. I couldn&apos;t beleve it when she told me that these aliens took her arm off and she saw them doing painful things to her twin sister. I told them that I had a visit too and showed them my hand. I had two tiny unexplainable scabs directly on my veins. I chose not to tell them until later in adulthood that I saw them in the white lights too, and in my dream I also saw that same daughter laying on a table without her arm. God&apos;s honest truth! To this day the twins become uncomfortable talking about it. They don&apos;t like to remember the bad experience and say that I am making up my admissions just to scare them. I wonder...can generations become targets of study?((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))"
"In the first sighting i could essentially draw you a picture of the craft and i was chased by a UFO in the 2nd sighting  After being extremely frightened over this 2nd UFO encounter in the past 2 weeks I had to mention these recent events to someone, just so it could be known.  The date today is the 11th of August, 2008.  This was actually my 2nd UFO encounter in about the past week and a half.  I would first like to talk about my first encounter which happened about 1 and a half weeks ago.  It was about 9:45 PM and I had been at my friend&rsquo;s house across town.  I started to head back home which was about a 15 minute drive.  On the way home I noticed 2 large lights about 60 to 80 feet hovering in the air, lights almost touching each other.  As I began to drive towards the lights I actually began to joke to myself that this might be a UFO.  I continued on highland drive and when I got to the Amort&rsquo;s farming fields I clearly saw this object floating soundless in the air.  Other cars drove extremely slow past this object, as if to wonder what was sitting up in the air.  The strange thing was of the 3 or 4 cars I saw pass this object, no one stopped or got out of their car, but each car drove past this thing at about 5mph to catch a glimpse.  As I drove past this object I could clearly see the shape and color of this unknown craft.  It was diamond shaped with 4 bright lights on each corner.  The crazy thing was you could see these lights from so far away but when you got up the craft the lights appeared pretty small.  Also when I looked into this light it didn&rsquo;t hurt my eyes as a regular light would.  As I rolled down the street almost directly under this craft I rolled down my window and heard no noise, at all.  Please tell me what can float 80 feet off the ground and not make noise.  The lights on the bottom of the craft are what created enough light to view the craft.  The bottom of the diamond was some sort of black material.  After passing the craft on the long street of highland I was only about 2 minutes away from my house and I wanted to get my brother and a video camera as proof to this sighting.  Unfo! rtunatel y when I arrived home he was gone and 10 minutes later when I returned the object had vanished.  When I got back home my parents were now there and I decided to tell them about this strange event.  On the way home they had seen this object in the Amort&rsquo;s farming fields just like I had.  I figured out that they passed by this same object about 5 minutes after I had.  My parent&rsquo;s first impression of the object was it was not normal and was a UFO.  They believed as they passed the object it began to move forward slowly but they never saw it disappear quickly.  The funny thing about this is that my family and I decided not to report this; I decided to report it after what happened to me, tonight, the night of August 11th.  I was over at one of my brother&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s houses and it was about 11:15 PM.  I was tired and decided to head back to my house.  I was almost to my street when I noticed a weird light hovering, in place, a good distance behind the Warlow&rsquo;s farming fields.  I decided that because of my recent sighting nearly 2 weeks ago, that I would park in their driveway and watch this red light.  I noticed that the object began to hover straight up into the air at a pretty fast pace.  The object reached a height of probably about 200 to 300 feet and began to move fast towards my vehicle.  At this point I was pretty much scared shit less and pulled back as fast I could and made a fast dash towards my house.  The object hovered parallel with my vehicle but essentially right above me.  I remember as I made the sharp turn onto my street I glanced out my window and up into the sky and there it was right above me, following me but still at an altitude of about 200 to 300 feet.  I could clearly see the lights on the UFO and the brightness of the moon made everything pretty visible.  It was high enough up that I couldn&rsquo;t quite make out the shape but it moved quickly.  At this point I was freaked out of my mind and my adrenaline was running.  The object proceeded to follow me up my street until I made it to a lar! ge pass of overhanging trees.  I live out in the forest and there are a lot of trees that hang over my street, it creates some good cover from the skies.  As I reached this pass of overhanging trees before my house I was continuously looking in the air to see if the UFO was still present.  When I got to my house I was so scarred I didn&rsquo;t even get out of my car.  I locked the doors and called my mom to open the front door of my house, so I could run in with no delays.  This event scared me to the point of reporting both these UFO incidents event though I had been contemplating revealing the first incident.  The thing about this 2nd one is that I was out by myself witnessing all of this.  My lights were shined out towards the UFO which probably got its attention because after about a minute or 2 it headed straight towards me.  I really thought this unknown craft was trying to do something the way it responded to me showing up and witnessing it out in the Warlow field.  The craft had 3 lights, 1 red and 2 white (bright).  This may sound like a plane or something but this was not, I know for a fact.  It made no sound, flew 200 to 300 feet above the ground almost directly above my car, the craft essentially engaged me and I ran.  In my mind I really believed it was trying to abduct me and luckily I was about 1 minute from my house and I went about 50 to 60 mph on a 25 mph street to escape this thing that was tailing me.  I strongly have believed in aliens before these events but I feel unsafe out here.  This is the 2nd UFO I have seen and unfortunately I have to pictures or videos to prove it, just the fact that my parents saw the first sighting and they strongly believe there was no possibility it was from this planet.  I&rsquo;m now carrying a video camera in my car and will update this site if I capture or see anything else.  I hope my word and others will soon unveil the alien presence on earth. P.S:  I just wrote this right after my 2nd incident with a UFO as seen above in my script"
"Possible humanoid being sighting/abduction attempt??((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain as to whether this is intended as a serious report.  PD))I recently stumbled upon your website and decided it time to report one of dozens of sightings in my life. I have witnessed dozens of flying objects as a keen sky observer and budding amateur astrologist.. but can&apos;t verify any of them as i always seem to be isolated and alone when it happens and many are most likely space junk causing &quot;shooting star&quot; like objects to fly across the night sky. I&apos;ve seen dozens of those now.I once reported to the Australian police a sighting of a perfectly round object hovering above my top floor apartment which appeared to be at least 5 miles wide.. this was ignored.. and I myself quickly wrote it off as just light refractions.My report here however is not of a UFO but of a being. I had walked out of my home late at night as i was studying.. it was approximately 1999.. so i cannot recall the exact date. The night was still and silent with no wind.I walked outside my back yard.. and spotted a white figure.. i estimate it to have been 4 feet tall.. and was all white with a subtle glow. I stood in frozen shock as we faced each other off for approximately 3 minutes. We stood only 5 meters apart so I could make out the shape but could not discern a face nor shoes.. it was completely white. In that time the object sat on top of my fence at the rear of my backyard which fell into parkland behind it, and made no effort to run away.. It did not move for the whole time, even as i approached- i got spooked when i was 5 meters away though and stopped purely because this figure did not seem worried by me approaching it.. we faced off for the next 3 long minutes.. and then eventually it slipped over the fence and disappeared. As it slipped away.. it did not make a single sound.. and nor did it make a sound as it left..The object did not move and as i stood frozen i simply stared at it, thinking it was a burgular. strangely though.. the figure simply disappeared after a few minutes. it did not make a single sound as it did. A burgular hopping off a fence would have made some noise.. and in the dead of night i would have at least heard leaves crunching underfoot.. but in this case there was not a single sound. it simply vanished. the fact it was all white left me to this day with the eery feeling that what i experienced that day was not a burgular but a potential visitor from another world.I could not see any discernable features other than it was a human type shape.. i did not see arms or legs though.. roughly 4 feet tall.. it seemed to be shaped like a round blob sitting on my fence.. and then like a jelly blob.. it flopped over the fence and disappeared.. it did not make a single noise in doing so and i did not hear a single noise thereafter.This story is not provable and more for your information than for public publishing.. the area where this happened could even be tested as the fence upon which the figure appeared has not been changed since..it could have been a potential burgular that night.. but if it was, then it was one highly skilled dude.. because not only was it terribly out of shape and unatheltic looking (it was shaped like Jabba the hut from Star Wars fame) but it managed to completely disappear without making a single sound in the dead of night.. and it seemed to just roll off the back fence..which is 8 feet tall..  also.. if it was a burgular why would it be wearing only white clothing.. they usually wear black..to this day.. the thought of that night sends a chill up my spine.. so i thought i would report it for documentation on your database.. this happened in a suburb called Ashbury in Sydney&apos;s inner city area ( the park is called Wagner Oval) .. a highly populated area but my home backs onto a large park which is where the figure disappeared into. it was also approximately 3am and no one else was on the streets at the time and the park was silent.my study is at the rear of my house overlooking my yard.. and my lights were always left on throughout the night as i studied for many years.. perhaps that attracted this figure.. a burgular again would have been deterred given that i was active till late all night.. this figure seemed to be sitting there just watching me.. until i noticed it, stared it off from a distance of only 5 meters.. it did not flinch nor seem worried either. it sat there the entire time before disappearing."
"abducted by circular ufo while camping I was camping in the Abbotsford outskirts area very late one night, and I was having issues sleeping because of my back, I was sitting outside by the campfire, when all of the sudden I felt an odd rumbling sensation in my abdomen. Compelled by this strange feeling, I picked up my flashlight and looked around the local area. I found nothing, and I decided to go and sit down again. I sat there for the next 20 minutes,with a growing feeling of uncertainty and discontent washing over me. That&apos;s when it happened.The air around me grew very warm, a high pitched sound reached my ears.  Unsure of what was happening, I stood up.  A bright light, with a red tint to it surrounded me.  I felt myself loosing consciousness, and I fell to the ground.I drifted in and out of consciousness, each time I awoke, I remember seeing a bright light and blurry silhouettes all around me. The most apparent thing to me was that the figures were very short, no taller than a meter or so, and the table I was lying on was very close to the ground. I remember that occasionally the abductors would speak to each other, always in a high-pitched, rushed sort of way.Many hours later, I woke up. I was outside. I stood up, and I felt dizzy. Stumbling, I looked around the small clearing I was in. I finally found my tent, after walking around for nearly 15 minutes.I wasn&apos;t exactly sure of what happened. I packed up my tent, and other camping gear as fast as I could. I drove back to my house and went to bed. My dreams were disturbed with strange dreams of symbols I&apos;d never seen before, as well as that same strange high-pitched noise I heard the previous night.Since then, I had a psychological evaluation done, and it came out completely fine. I am thoroughly convinced that I have come into contact with extra-terrestrials of some kind. Before that incident, I was like many people, a skeptic. I write this now as a believer, one who has experienced abduction, and has to live with it&apos;s horrible repercussions for the rest of my life."
"Missing Time July 31, 1997 It happened on July 31, 1997  I had seen something a few days earlier when I was in the backyard and called mom and told her about it, sometime the next morning several others saw the same UFO I did but they made a official report and were talking about it on Art Bell and it made the papers.. I had seen the UFO heading south toward California and it was seen by the others over Medford near the California border, later that same morning.After this sighting when I heard others talking about it on the radio and read about it in the paper, I decided to call Peter Davenport,at the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, Peter had been up most all night taking reports with all the sightings in Medford and was very tired and did not have time to take the report, or at least this is what I believe that he said.  I took it personally and thought I would never call Peter again (not Peters&rsquo; fault, just my own judgment of the situation. I was helping out a friend in a small store here and told her about it and was still smarting at how Peter had treated me, or I thought he had treated me, and told her about that too.Anyway I was home watching TV, my husband was about to go to bed, he is needs lots of sleep.. he reminded me to lock the back door and put the stick in it.. that way if the cats get ancy we can open the patio door, put a stick in it and let them go in and out at will... anyway I said I would, and did, and he went to bed and I lay down on the couch and was out like a light, fully dressed/shoes too The next thing I remember was waking up and seeing it was time to feed the cats, it was about 7AM.. my husband was in his computer room and the back door was open, the stick had been removed, I got up, fed cats and my husband and was relaxing watching TV news with my second cup of coffee, when the phone rang and it was &lt;former boss&gt;, she was calling me to see if I was alright, and to ask me about the lights, I said you mean the ones I saw the other night? She said NO the ones you saw this morning.. I said I did not see any lights this morning and she said Yes you did, she again said are you OK?   I said YES I was fine, why wouldn&apos;t I be.. she said after your call this morning about the lights, I said what call, she said the one you made to me early this morning, she said you left me a message.. I wanted to hear it but she had erased it not thinking about it, but had listened to the message numerous times and had written it down verbatim&apos; and signed the paper.. this is what she said the message said... (my remarks)  &lt;name&gt;, this is CK, I&apos;m really sorry to call you at this time, it is 2:40 AM, in the morning, I am out by North Salem High School ( this is about 3 miles from my home) and I have been watching a bright light in the sky for about 45 minutes.If you know Peter Davenports number or one who does that sort of thing down here (In Salem) they need to be called. I am looking south and a little east and the large light is very bright, too big to be a star. There are 3 smaller lights in a line down one side and I can see two in a line down the other side, but there may be a third one, I can&apos;t see from here. It hasn&apos;t moved. If you know who investigates these please call them and tell them the information because there is no way this is stars..End of recording/message..I told &lt;name&gt; that she was kidding, right? she said &quot;No I swear its true&quot;  I asked her where I called from, she said she did not know, but that when I was done I did not say goodbye or anything, the line just went totally blank/dead, and it had a empty tinny sound.I called my husband into the living room and asked him when he took the stick out of the patio door? He said I thought you did, the door was open when I got up about 6:00 AM.. I ran to the front door, and it was closed but unlocked, it had been locked and a separate latch used, that was also open.. then I went into the driveway, scared of what I would find, and there was my car, parked on the opposite side of the driveway than I usually park.. I was terrified.. Where had I been, what had I done?  I asked my husband did you get up to go to the bathroom last night? He is usually up 2-3 times a night, NO he said for some reason he had not awakened till just before he got up..I grabbed my purse and drove over to the high school, I got out of the car near the football field and walked over to the fence surrounding the field, trying to remember what I might have seen, did anything trigger a memory, and all that happened was that I got very dizzy, but walked around looking for some clue as to what had happened.. I remember looking for a tan shingled roof I had been standing near and wanted to check that out on the letter from &lt;name&gt;and was very surprised to see she/I had not mentioned any such roof or color of shingles in the message so it must have been a memory of the event..the only one I have had of that night.I am fortunate to know a lot of UFO researchers and I immediately called my old friend Dr Leo Sprinkle who works with abductees, some researchers or psychologists make the event scary, but if Dr Sprinkle does the same interview the abduction becomes a positive experience not a negative one, a learning experience.I was terrified about what could have happened... what if I would have had a car accident? a flat tire? How would I explain being out driving alone at 2:40 AM?   Dr Sprinkle pointed out that I was likely totally alert and in control till I got home and that is when they took remove any  memory of what happened..This still haunts me and I still check the doors several times during the evening hours to be sure they are locked. For over a year I had slept fully dressed in a sweat suit complete with shoes etc.Note: Peter is always open and willing to listen to urgent reports. I just took his being tired personally and that was my problem, not Peters&rsquo; short coming. CK 7/31/97"
"Life changing mind blowing unreal to much for 1 person3  500 Lights On Object0: YesUFO sightings saw 2 smaller orb like objects that circle each other then try to blend in sky like stars for 30 to 45 minutes as soon as the first couple stars are in the sky the orbs would do a little circle routine or hover aimlessly within a mile or 2 radius of house at about 35 to 50 thousand ft also 2 bigger UFO&apos;s with red/white lights at least 35ft each possibly bigger. 1 moved a lot possibly landed about half a mile from my place or someone was messing with me my guess is NOT But it looked like it was just hovering above the ground could not have been no more than 6 to 10ft .Tried to take picture but my camera couldn&apos;t capture image. Glowing orb sightings occurred April 16-22 of 2009 the other 2 bigger ships showed the 16th and 17th only the one big ship returned April 19-22 but here is the best part on 4/21 between 12 o clock and 1 o clock at night I was actually getting very scared had no car or phone to get the hell out of dodge and I herd a jet so ran on the porch to see what was about to happen and thought I was gonna see something really cool  ha!! Nope the jet flying between 10 maybe 15 thousand ft. flew directly over the house with his burners on and a maybe a mile or 2 away was the UFO  the jet just flew by or just didn&apos;t see it either way I felt a little less worried because I thought somebody finally made the call it did take of about 30 seconds later or I thought that just a cloud covering it without the cloud.Me being irrational with the reality of the situation ran to the middle of the driveway with my binoculars I noticed this pain in the back of my head that me and my mother had felt on 16th but she was to freaked out by the whole idea and actually said she was scared she was gonna get picked up and dropped of ha!! so most every night I got my binoculars and watched the orbs circling each other but they came a little earlier each night the 2 orbs were never out with the other 2 UFOs that i could see they always came before the UFOs with red/white light&apos;s.Also I&apos;m 10! 0% sure they were not airplanes because most of the time I would be watching the UFOs and planes would go by. Also that area is flooded with air traffic day and night but those first 2 nights there was so many airplane there was at least 1 or more in my sight at all times and no noise at all from the orbs and flight characteristics matched none of today&apos;s jets/plains/helicopter hovered like a balloon but picked up to much speed to fast.It was not shooting stars very simple very clear. I also know a few people who live in that area a good chunk of their life who have witnessed UFO activity in the area years ago.These were not my first sightings in the area 2 times before to be exact witch leads me to my next words. 2 people told me they saw a UFO years earlier in the area.I look at the stars since the dish got cut off about a month ago I would not have saw any of it if i had not talked to my grandmother that day .At first it when the orbs arrived I could not be drag in the house all I wanted to do was get that awesome footage and watch it over every night.But each night was a little different but on the 4th day I was doing a lot of thinking and was also filled with excitement fear I just wasn&apos;t thinking strait.I would sometimes turn on the porch light before I would go outside or to let dogs in and out so eventually  what ever was flying those aircraft had to see me turning on the porch light the UFO,s returned every night for something they would hover for hours some nights so when they stopped in the sky right in front of the house and they got a little closer as they were circling and dropping altitude slowly closer towards the ground.They knew I was there I just didn&apos;t really think about it until the orbs chilled in the air for a couple hours and it was still 4/20 about 10 o clock to top it all of I was by my myself no running vehicle and I finally realized if they/it whatever could build aircraft such as the ones they/it/him/her what ever posses they probably have technology or something that lets them know ! I&apos;m ther e. I ignored my worst fears and the hurt in my head to see if the other 1or 2 UFO,s were doing their thing about a mile or so away the fear is the 2 orbs froze in the sky circling away.I tried to take more pictures worthless attempts the camera sucks so it was another fail.So I sat on the porch looking at the sky above a airplane was passing and a really bright light caught my eye from strait above it was the second UFO from the mountain it&apos;s lights shined bright white ember and red  for about 5 seconds then quickly cut of its lights. After that my brain couldn&apos;t let me watch any more i had seen to much it could have been right above me the entire time it had demonstrated it&apos;s superior capabilities. I couldn&apos;t take it I came close to calling the 5-0 to do what.But at 12:32 4/21 I heard the jet and I couldn&apos;t help to think what if those where aliens that would mean that this planet could be taken if so pleased seeing demonstrations 1 after another. now for but I know the Crafts could have returned again last night i could not tell you yes or no because i was typing this. I can take a chance and look like a fool or do NOTHING.  4/25/09   pss i wrote this on the 4/24 and 25th and i returned to my house at about 8 or 9 on the night of the 25th and the UFOs did return again about it seen much more UFO activity last night more than what is normally out actually.Not sure all how many or if any other people in the area know about the UFO  activity in the area . But I checked online to see if any UFO had been reported in the area  but nothing has ever been reported in that area till now.But i heard some people on a plane over North Carolina seen UFO in Feb i really wouldn&apos;t doubt it  or just t don&apos;t care.4/27/09 Saw 3 UFO&apos;s within 1 hour. I only watched for a hour or so then retired for the night.  4/28/09 OK this time i saw 3 UFO&apos;s circling near an airplane was pretty close to the 3 orbs glowing a ember or copper color . I honestly would not be surprised if people or pilots do not report seeing them.Also 3 extra! UFO&apos;s i n where in the sky last night. and I also seen the shape of UFO that was a  triangle it had 6 lights that shined a bright white and I now think it was one like the triangle UFO that landed or just hovered over neighbors yard but to be honest I don&apos;t really know the shape of the craft that hovered over the neighbors yard but because I took 6 pictures on the 16th and looked at them on my computer the 17th no good except for I could see something in 1 picture that was above the ground that looked like a silver line but thought nothing of it and deleted it because I thought it was just camera error and another pic with bubble light if that makes since looked like bubbles that were lite up from the inside out all over the picture and i didn&apos;t even mean to take a picture I turned around to go on the porch after many failed pictures and it just took a pic but now it would make since because I thought that was 1 of the 2 with the red and white lights I just couldn&apos;t say because I only seen the lights on them but now I&apos;m 50% sure that the 2 with the red and white lights were triangle while the other 2 were orb shaped but only from a distance I am still not sure of their  true shape yet but i will try to find out.I&apos;ve also seen more UFO&apos;s but these that i have written about have always came back and hang around in the area for hours or a few minutes at a  time. sometimes they leave and return the same night but there are also many others but are just passing through the area  i do know is that there is a air base or something around  4/29/09 also sorry for not sending this sooner but this is one of the biggest decision of my life and  i fear you guys will come to check it out and the UFO&apos;s will have left the area and I will look like A dumb ass.Just contact me by email if you have any questions.1 Last thing i have not really left any specific time records for sightings well I also didn&apos;t keep count but if i did it be about 30 just since April 16/09 and i would be happy to take a lie detector test if needed you can! imagine that i am very confused with what I am seeing and for a while after i seen my first real UFO right by house about 200ft in the air and the craft was at least 60ft to 70ft I was beyond petrified and terrorfied my mom was in the next room so I holler to show her and it was moving at about 30mph we got out on the porch and it was going right over the tree line at a near by mountain with only 1 dim white light on and i started turning the flash light on and off and it brighten it&apos;s light and froze in mid air over the mountain for a couple of seconds then faded from sight as it hovered the mountain I thought i was hallucinating basically I thought i was going insane my mom saw it to or she says she did.The 2nd time I was at the end of the driveway using the cell phone and this time I was alone but I was talking to somebody who I couldn&apos;t exactly tell there is a UFO and the front is visible and the rest is like not there.The guy would have laughed hung up and had me in a padded room within the hour plus I didn&apos;t tell anyone mainly because nobody could believe this anyway. So I thought to my self ? there was a front and it was black I thought it was some birds flying in like a formation but first of all it was to even if birds are flying that close together there is gonna be some birds getting ahead even 1ft  movement in fly formation it would look squiggly and no wings flapping and no space between the wings of the birds that&apos;s when I started thinking great another UFO maybe I&apos;m not crazy.It was also like 6oclock day time sunny not dark at all.It was only about 100yards in the air and it was moving to slow to some birds flying and I couldn&apos;t think of anything else that even looks like that did and still cant.I can only say the front was shaped like an ark it was black and if this was a UFO it was about 120ft wide at least and the rest wasn&apos;t even visible I&apos;M not sure why all of this shit is all within 3mile radios of the house.At first i thought they had their own private base somewhere in the mountains that ! was my o wn little crap theory so I remembered the direction the 1st UFO was headed then the 2nd then i figured out if there was a base I got the general direction it might be in but here is the interesting part there is a water fall in the direction I figured the base would be not a base but a person i know and his friend saw a UFO up at the water fall years ago.Another person i know said he saw one out the house window. saw diamond shaped UFO same kind I had seen at my old  house but in a different place 2 times and to top it all of A jet was chasing a UFO right above my head at about 20 to 35 thousand ft. I was gonna send a email to Ktox to show UFO hunters in April but to much pressure and I was moving so instead I just let it eat at my soul if i ever had one. I will fill out a crap report that people will laugh at anyway but if my best friend told me this shit I would have called the nut hut. I also found out that during the days of my April 16th/25th UFO sighting people all over the planet were witnessing the strange crafts I even watched a video of  2 orbs in a different place i didn&apos;t really expect that A month later but its crazy. also many left out details and UFO sightings.also temperarly disabled the DVD player with fuzzy black and white picture kinda twisted blackness on 4/20 weak also had 2 pretty weird dreams during those nights maybe caused by stress and fear.Also i forgot to mention April/16/09 I called my friend then called my grandma that lives in Delaware for the first time in 2 years i call her and talk till cell phone goes dead then charge up and go back to the end of the drive way to get cell phone reception.Anyway I didn&apos;t tell here about my second UFO sighting just my first and she told me her and her daughter saw 2 orb shaped UFO&apos;s that were as she describes circling each other kinda like they were just playing with each other so I was starting to feel not as insane after she told me that but she didn&apos;t know how twisted my mind was from the my 2nd sighting and we started discussing how we think the world is failing I said [to be completely honest i don&apos;t think the world is gonna make it to long at the rate its going and humanity will eventually kill itself with the pride in the nations starting pride wars  they wont just unit as people and just get it over with and start the road to mega science and eventually humans leave earth to go explore the universe] And she was saying now days it&apos;s scary to even consider having  a kid in the world today and I was standing by the mail box and it was starting to get dark but I was just looking up in the sky and i saw i just waited about 5 seconds to think see holy shit mum mum there are 2 orbs just circling each other just like mum mum said like 10 minutes earlier my mind was bent way to far then so i ran in the house got my mom and they were gone I knew then I had lost my fuckin mind i told mum mum they were gone and nobody seen them once again then I told her about my second siting and how crazy I am because i COULD HAVE SWORN i JUST SAW THEM 2 UFOs i said then she says your not crazy and if they just poped up from the sky they will be back I started telling her no they won&apos;t because I&apos;m just crazy but i waited a couple minutes and told her that&apos;s the biggest coincidence of my life but still not sure of reality untill the orbs show up again I got my moms and her boyfriend to check it out and sure enough they ! were rea l I wasn&apos;t crazy my mind untied for the moment just untill the 2 bigger UFOs were chillin over a mountain till later then me and my mom was trying to take the pictures of them in the sky then 1 of the UFOs flew over a mountain it was amazing to even be able to watch it just move at all to even see the damn thing then lights were flashing near the ground I knew if i didn&apos;t say anything just give it 10 seconds max and my mom said do yo see that light on the ground she say what the hell is that I was still focused on the other UFO in the sky mainly the lights because they were flashing the same colors and it wasn&apos;t the neighbors TV on in the camper.Looking at it threw the binoculars was making my heart speed and hands shake and could see the light on very clear as they flashed different colors purple red blue green i don&apos;t remember all the colors but at some point a truck went by maybe 100 to 125ft from the object from the road it lasted about 30 minutes and only got weirder as the lights in the sky were synchronized flashing of colors with those just of the craft that just hovered over the ground a quarter mile away then gone like nothing but it was back over a mountain after that mom wouldn&apos;t even go to check out the UFOs with me any other night except 1 more time to see a triangle UFO crawl across the sky and when it went over the mountain she was back in the house she missed the best part after a couple minutes passed the bright white light on the craft looked awesome as it went to fast for my guesses i just know it picked up and haled ass out of that valley and her boyfriend just wants nothing to do with any of that but now he is all about some gay brown mountain lights or something i told him this is maybe once in a lifetime thing you might never see anything this amazing ever again he didn&apos;t even respond.these events took place on April/16-17/2009 believe it or not this shit happened and still is happening all over the world is my guess it doesn&apos;t just happen near my house and my neighbors front yard! ...1 mor e thing I had a dream and all I really remember is seeing the alien face as i lay on a table or something and it was over me then i woke up and my right eye was twitching really bad I don&apos;t think it was an abduction more like fear and stress and some other issues coming out but the other dream well may have been a abduction because I&apos;ve never felt like i&apos;m awake with my eyes closed but couldn&apos;t move I felt paralyzed I knew I wanted my eyes open but I just lay there and I don&apos;t know how long but when i finally came to i knew that has never happened and i felt like I was floating and then i felt the couch i was sleeping on touching me and time could not even be measured in the stat i was in I felt violated with life and still do i haven&apos;t called any of my friends or spoke to my granny since 4/17/09 and every minute of every day most all day till i go to sleep than wake up with it on my mind it never goes away and not showing my friends was a mistake but what if they got abducted then how would i feel because when i would see UFOs I would give em the finger I used to say if i ever see A UFO I&apos;m gonna shoot at it.THESE ARE THE MOST OUTRAGES CLAIMS YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD well i don&apos;t care because every word of it is true."
"UFO orbs appear during intense MCV thunderstormI&apos;m senior in college at Missouri State University.  I was sleeping in because it was dead day, Friday May 8, which is always study day the Friday before finals.  I was woken up by tornado sirens and a really terrible thunderstorm at 9am.  The power was also out.  We get really bad thunderstorms but this one took the cake.  From www.weather.com/newscenter/stormwatch/:  &quot;MCV becomes - Inland Hurricane:  May 8, 2009 brought a derecho, a widespread windstorm associated with a bow echo thunderstorm complex, along a 600-mile-long, 60-mile wide swath across southeast KS, south MO, and south IL. Many of the damaging winds were not with the leading line of severe thunderstorm, but rather behind it and beneath a mid-level rotation center called an MCV - mesoscale convective vortex. Winds gusted to 106 mph. At least 220,000 customers lost power in MO and IL. The system spawned more than 30 tornadoes, at 20 of them in southwest MO. EF3 tornadoes hit Howell County MO and Garrard County KY.&quot;  This storm was crazy.  It was pounding my off campus apartment.  I could hear pieces of metal siding being ripped off the building.  It was the weirdest thing...the winds were blowing straight at the building, driving the rain around the edges of the sliding glass door and spraying my living room with water.  I was freaking out.  It was very intense, and I was frantically trying to figure out how to keep the water out.  The winds began to calm down a bit, and I was running around my apartment trying to find the memory card to my camera.  I&apos;m a sort of an amateur meteorologist and love taking storm photos.  I&apos;m a photography and graphic design major, and I have a Canon 40d with a number of lenses, including a solid zoom 100-400mm L.  However, I couldn&apos;t find my 16gb memory card and nearly ripped my apartment apart trying to find it.  I couldn&apos;t even find my backup 4gb card, which was odd, because its always in my bag. After several minutes of frantic searching, I stopped for some reason, in my living room, turned to my right, and out the back sliding glass door window was the weirdest sight.  It was like an orb shaped thing, combined with a fireball, perhaps a few miles in the distance hovering beyond the middle school behind my apartment.  It was really weird because it seemed to be wiggly...like it had waves coming off of it that were vibrating.  It was bright white, and the edges seemed to be yellowish orange.  The first thing I thought was that something exploded in mid air, and this is where my memory is a little fuzzy because I&apos;m reporting this many months later (which I&apos;ll explain soon).  I&apos;m pretty sure that another one appeared on the sides of it, which made me think it was an aircraft.  Sometimes aircraft fly under thunderstorms to avoid the dangerous updrafts.  But the way the lights radiated was just too weird.  Then they each disappeared, one by one, quickly.  What ticked me ! off the most was that even though I had my camera around my neck, I couldn&apos;t take a photo!  Gaaahh!  Ridiculous.  So I grab my iPhone, text my fiance and roommate to tell them what happened, and then looked up Springfield&apos;s airport website to find arrival / departure times.  There were no planes landing near the time that I saw the lights, and Springfield, being a small town of 150k, it doesn&apos;t get many large aircraft landing during the day.  Also the lights didn&apos;t seem to be moving in any direction, and if they were coming head on, that wouldn&apos;t make any sense either, because the airport is on the NE fringe of town and I was right in the middle of town, and even though its a small town, its spread out over 88 square miles because they don&apos;t know how to build up in these small towns.  The other explanation would be ball lightning, which hasn&apos;t been scientifically proven to exist, but has been observed by many people in the past. So here is some background info on why I&apos;m posting this so far after the fact: tonight I was watching UFO Hunters on the History channel and they showed these orbs on there that have been occuring in the Ozarks around Springfield this year and some of the video and artist&apos;s renditions looked a lot like what I saw and it freaked me out.  I didn&apos;t get the same feeling of dread when I saw it that other people have reported, but I did feel like I was frozen and couldn&apos;t move.  It was pretty wild.  They also reported about a light on the north side of town, and I also believe I have seen this light before when driving back in forth to Bolivar, MO to see my friends at SBU.  It just seems too bright and out of place for that area of the sky and I only notice it sometimes.  I feel like I have a fairly solid grasp of astronomy, having taken a college course where we had to learn about heavenly objects and went out to Baker Observatory (which ironically is near Marshfield, where on UF! O hunters a highway patrolman reported an orb following him) on several occasions to observe the night sky.  My dad was also an amateur astronomer when I was younger and we would go outside and look at the stars frequently. I&apos;m also not a crazy UFO person, but a fairly rational college student.  However, I feel like I have some sort of odd connection with UFOs.  When I was in elementary school I would have horrible horrible night terrors of being abducted by aliens and when I was in 10th grade, I had another encounter I&apos;d like to share.  Feel free to remove this for the reporting post but I want to submit it along with this for completeness:  My best friend and I were driving home late on a Thursday night from the movies near midnight, which was my curfew in 10th grade.  My best friend is very smart, an Eagle Scout and a member of the Stretch program at school for highly intelligent students.  We were both in advanced placement programs for math and literature.   Since it was so long ago (2001-2002?) I can&apos;t remember the date at all. We were waiting at a red light at 7hwy and 40hwy in Blue Springs, MO, a suburb of Kansas City.  We saw three orb lights, in a triangle formation, float over the HyVee grocery store, turn while crossing 40hwy, and then float over the WalMart.  Then they suddenly zoomed off at incredibly high speed in the direction of my house.  The way they moved made us feel like they were attached.  Both of us saw the lights and were a bit freaked out.  That&apos;s when things started to get really crazy.  As we continued down 40 hwy and the other two roads [road names REDACTED, since it&apos;s near my parent! s house], nearly every single street light we passed by suddenly went out.  It was making us very scared, especially since we were in a convertible.  My friend pulled into the circle drive I lived on, and dropped me off at the bottom of the driveway.  Before getting out, I noted that it was 11:55pm, before curfew, since I was worried about getting back in time.  When I got inside, my dad half-joked that I was late (it wasn&apos;t a serious violation) and I said &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;  I looked at the time and it was 12:05am.  I was so confused.  How did it take me 10 minutes to walk inside?  I went straight inside.  So I talked to my friend the next day and he told me something pretty interesting (and scary).  Apparently when he was at the stop sign to leave my circle drive, he saw a bright flash in his rear view mirror.  He turns around, and he said he couldn&apos;t see me anywhere.  He then drove away quickly, which at the time ticked me off that he just left me like that.  ! That about freaked the hell out of me. I&apos;ve only told these stories to a few people, but figured that I might as well come forward now.  I bet there are a lot of normal people out there, like me, who would never google UFO reports and actually type up something like this and send it in because they would think that they must be crazy.  But I am starting to think that there is something to this whole UFO thing and that if I didn&apos;t share this, then I wouldn&apos;t be helping anyone figure out what&apos;s going on.  I also got my accurate times for the first report from the messaging app on my iPhone.  I sent the text to my fiance right after the event (and I also sent her one right after I awoke to tornado sirens, she lived in the Kansas City area at the time) and it was logged in the app.  Honestly, I have no idea what&apos;s going on, but its starting to freak me out a bit that stuff that I&apos;ve seen is showing up on TV in the town I live in when I thought that there must be a rational explanation.  I just can&apos;t get my mind aroun! d the idea that there are aliens flying around the earth.  It just doesn&apos;t seem possible.  I just thought that was something to be scared of as a child, like monsters or the boogie man.  If it&apos;s proven that aliens are real, then it&apos;s going to be really hard for me to deal with that.  It just doesn&apos;t make sense!  Why would they even appear like this or take people?  What is the motive?  Are they bored?  Why not just come down and show themselves?  Are they just having fun with us?  It is so weird that other people have seen something similar to what I saw.  It is even more weird that there have been enough people seeing things that a UFO tv show came to this town to interview people.  I wish they would go away because now I&apos;m fearful of their presence and my possible connection to them.  Also my mom told me a couple years ago that my grandpa used to see ufos, strage lights, and would awake in the middle of the night, at the window, sleepwalking, talking to them outside the w! indow.  My mom saw a ufo with them when she was younger, hover! ing over a car in a parking lot late one night.  That was probably sometime in the late 70s early 80s.  Is there something about my family that attracts them?  Or is it a coincidence?  Sorry for the rambling, I&apos;ve got a huge project due in the morning and it&apos;s getting late!  Time to get back to work...feel free to edit this to make it more cohesive for online consumption.  Thanks for your time."
"woman figure in red bodysiut with large head  Sometime during 1981 I had a dream that has not left my memory.  I now believe it was not a dream but an abduction experience.  This occurred in Huntsville, Alabama at night. I have three memories: I was placed in a seat that looked like plastic similar to fast food restaurants.  It was curved and had a high back that protruded above my head.  I was not belted in the seat but I was stuck there and could not move.  My eyes were open but unable to move so I could only see in front of me.  There was a man sitting across from me in a same type of seat, and he was not moving either.  I could see more seating behind him but with the design I could not see anyone sitting.The second memory I woke up and was on a table in the middle of a room.   I was laying with my head in the south and my feet in the north.  My eyes could not look around, but I could see part of the ceiling and part of the wall on my right.  It appeared to look rounded and somewhat reminded me of commercial office partitions, grey/silver and flat.  I did not know where I was, then my head rolled to the left and I saw a woman walking up a small ramp to a door that I heard open with a &quot;swish&quot; sound, like a hatchback car when you open it.  I could see a little of the hall way and it appeared to curve slightly.The woman was wearing a red bodysuit and seemed to be physically fit.  I saw her head was different, it was larger in the back like it was deformed and her hair was blonde and extremely thin like a chemo patient that is losing most of their hair.  She was on the west side of the room and to the left of me.She had to know I was looking at her from behind because after the door opened she quickly turned and looked at me.  I saw her in the front view before she knocked me back out apparently with her mind, she did not say anything.  Her body seemed human but I have never seen a face similar to her.She had a bigger forehead and bigger eyes than a human, her nose was extremely small, almost no cartilage and reminds me of Michael Jacksons small nose.  Her mouth was small too with very thin lips.The last memory I was in a different seat facing west looking at black windows.  I saw the seat I had been in and it was emply, I still could not look around but I saw a door to the north behind the seat I was in in the first memory.  I was next to the wall and remember the rectangle rounded windows.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date during 1981 is approximate.  PD))"
"i saw a ufo land and aliens come out  Hello, It&apos;s 5/24/10 my name is ((name deleted)). I&apos;m 26 year&apos;s old with two little girls....I don&apos;t really know who to tell my story to.I&apos;ve had these strange sorts of events happening to me throughout my life.  They were coupled with different feelings... confusion, fear, disbelief.None of it really made sense until I saw in detail what I&apos;m about to tell you.  I knew that everything I had questioned before was no longer questionable.  It was undisputed in my mind.  It has been going on my entire life and now there is finally an event that proves (to me) that this is real.I&apos;ll start by telling you that my cousin ((name deleted)) was with me when this happened...  He has been in the navy now for about 8 years.  He is a trustworthy person and his word means a lot to everyone that knows him.  Not only is it me telling the story, but he can verify that what I&apos;m telling you is true.My cousin and myself were sitting on the back porch of my house (which was also my bedroom).  It was my bedroom at the time because it was a room enclosed with glass walls.  Some of the sections of the glass had been removed and either had screens remaining or nothing left in them at all.  Since it was summer, this wasn&apos;t really a problem.  I actually loved being in a room that allowed me to look outside at nature and even the stars.We had a couch-bed in the room that was unfolded at the time.  It was unfolded for most of the summer so that my cousin could sleep over and &quot;hang out&quot; with me.  The backside of the couch-bed was placed against the glass, so the unfolded bed occupied the space in the room facing the house.We were laying in bed trying to sleep but we spent most of our time talking instead.  Then, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a red glowing orb that came into view from behind the house and was slowly moving across the sky.  *See Attached Photo*  I got ((name deleted)) attention and we both watched the orb move across the treeline that was north of the trailer park.  It seemed to not be as far away as a plane should be.  It look to be about the size of a basketball approximately 50 yards away.  I then realized that it was getting closer and that it clearly was not a plane.As it moved across the sky, we watched as this incredible UFO was slowly moving toward a treeline where we assumed it would disappear out of our lives forever.But instead of disappearing into the sky... I could still see it through the trees moving towards the ground. I could clearly see it flickering through the trees and I would estimate it to be approximately 10 feet off of the ground as it entered the field on the left.  It had clearly made a 90 degree turn. At this point in time I realized that it was probably in the field that was on the other side of the treeline.  (Treeline: small patch of woods separating the trailer park and a field.)  It traveled the length of the field before I could not see it through the trees anymore.  I would estimate the length of the field to be about 200 yards.My cousin and myself sat in awe even after we could not see the UFO anymore.  He turned to me and said &quot;let&apos;s go check it out!&quot;  I sternly answered with, &quot;hell no! are you f**king crazy??&quot;  I was not sure what I had just seen but I had a gut feeling that I did not want to find out. So, we waited...waited... two young boys waiting to see something else as amazing as what they had just witnessed.Then it happened...A flash, as if someone had taken a picture from a camera, appeared at my friend ((name deleted)) trailer.  It was on the other side of her trailer, preventing me from seeing the source of the flash.Approximately two minutes later, another flash... this time, from the side of her trailer. I still couldn&apos;t clearly see the source of the flash.At this point, my cousin and I were starting to think something strange was happening.A few moments later, another flash. This time, I could clearly see the source of the flash... nothing.  It appeared as if the flash was angled towards ((name deleted)) house, although there was no source of the flash.  There was absolutely nothing visible to the naked eye that created this OBVIOUS flash.  Bud and myself both KNEW that flashes that are that distinct do NOT come from NOTHING.We waited about five more minutes still staring out into the trailer court through my glass room.  We were now more worried about what was in the court than what we had seen earlier.  Without speaking to each other for what seemed like five or ten minutes, another flash happened.This time it was at my friend ((name deleted)) house - directly in front of my house.  The flash was on the other side of the trailer and appeared to be aimed at his mothers bedroom.  Again we waited... wondering what the flashes were.Another couple minutes had gone by.  Another flash.This time, it was clearly pointed at Tommy&apos;s window and there was NOTHING at the source of the flash.  In my mind I could pinpoint, to the INCH, where the flash had started, yet there was nothing there. ((name deleted)) looked to me and said,  &quot;what the hell are those flashes?&quot;  I had no reply.  I wanted to remain silent and hidden from whatever had been making the flashes.Again we waited.About another five minutes passed when there was a flash on the other side of Mr. Wilson&apos;s house.  (That wasn&apos;t his real name, but we knew him as Mr. Wilson in the trailer park.)  So, we waited what seemed like forever.  In reality, it was probably 15 to 20 minutes with no sign of flashes or anything similar to them.Quite suddenly, Bud looked at me and said &quot;well, I&apos;m getting tired. wake me if anything happens.&quot;  He then put his head right down on his hands where he was sitting (propped up on his knees on the backside of the couch bed).I said, &quot;okay&quot; but wondered how anybody in their right mind could just fall asleep that fast after witnessing what we had witnessed. In my mind,  I would not go to sleep until the sun was up and people were awake.I started to get the strange feeling that the happening wasn&apos;t over.  Then... I started piecing things together that were quite simple and obvious.1. ((name deleted)) lives with her mother and father.  There were 3 flashes at her trailer. (aimed at their bedrooms&hellip; )  2. ((name deleted)) lives with his mother. There were 2 flashes at his trailer. (aimed at their bedrooms, also...)  3. Mr. ((name deleted)) lives alone. There was one flash.I figured that if they had gone through flashing every individual, as they went around from left to right in the court, since Wilson was last they had to turn around and come up the other line of trailers...starting with mine.I almost panicked as I came to the realization of what I believed was true.I turned my head in the direction of where I believed the thing causing the flash to be.  As I turned my head I could clearly see out my window (one that did not have glass or screen in it - open - nothing obstructing my view) an alien.  I had turned quick enough to spot him before I saw a flash come from, what seemed like, his forehead..........When the flash hit me, he disappeared and I realized I was completely paralyzed.  As I tried to move my limbs, I looked around to realize that I was no longer on the same part of my bed that I had been during the flash.  I was, in fact, at the foot of my bed on my knees staring at the open window as if nothing had happened. Instantly, the numbness was gone.I grabbed the back of Bud&apos;s leg (because he was in the same position that he had been in when he laid his head down...)  It appeared that he had not moved at all.  But somehow I was at least 4 feet away from where I was when I had seen the flash...?  When I grabbed his leg I screamed extremely loud &quot;BUD! wake up!&quot;  His head came off of his hands with his eyes wide as if he knew something wasn&apos;t right.We didn&apos;t have to say anything to each other as we both jumped up and ran into the kitchen.  We each armed ourselves with butcher knives, not knowing how much time had gone by or if the threat was still around. He asked me what had happened.  The only way I could really describe it to him was &quot;I was flashed..&quot;  Bud KNEW what I meant by that, which told me that I wasn&apos;t just seeing things and that I wasn&apos;t alone.After about two minutes of silence.. waiting for something else to happen.. we finally laughed at the fact that we were standing armed in the kitchen with knives... waiting for aliens to come.It seemed ridiculous to us.  Although it had clearly just happened, we couldn&apos;t really wrap our minds around it.  So, we laughed it off and this time we went to bed INSIDE of the house, instead of the room surrounded with glass windows.(This event has made me realize that more than one time in my life - for a split second - I have seen aliens and &quot;the flash&quot;. I have seen them in my bedroom window... I have seen them outside of my tent while sleeping in the woods* the same woods that are between the trailer park and the field I described*... I have had many occasions where, just for a second, I believed that I had been part of an alien abduction. Seeing what I have seen and the fact that I have witnessed a UFO, I have seen that UFO land in my field, I have seen something flash friends and neighbors, and I have been flashed by something that came from the sky... this is not your ordinary alien story because to this day I cannot say that I fully remember ever communicating with an alien or being aboard their &quot;crafts&quot;. But that doesn&apos;t mean that I haven&apos;t seen, felt, or experienced something extremely out of the ordinary. My cousin was there as a witness to the UFO and to all six flashes... (the seventh, of co! urse, being my own) I have no explanation as to WHAT exactly the flashes are or WHAT they do to people, but I do think that they were meant for individual people... and to somehow make a person &quot;unaware&quot; that something is going on... whether by putting them to sleep... paralyzing them... or wiping out their memory... I don&apos;t know for certain. What I do know for certain is that I have had many encounters with them and I believe that I truly know how they arrive. To put it bluntly, I&apos;ve caught them in the act of flashing people. I believe that they were completely unaware that I had spotted them, until it was too late. I feel as though they knew that they had made a mistake. I had witnessed their mistake and I almost FELT the reaction of the alien as.. panic. For the instant that I saw him, I knew in my gut that he was as scared of me as I was of him. I knew that their &quot;routine&quot; was not supposed to have been witnessed by anyone. We are supposed to be dazed and unaware by the ! flash when they come.)((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))"
"Triangular shaped objectI was driving west on State highway 4 between Rosburg and Naselle at about 20:00.  I hadn&rsquo;t even gotten a half mile from my house when I saw a triangular shaped craft floating slowly above tree line next to me, to the north.  It was moving in a south easterly direction.  The only thing in the are it was coming from is forest.  The direction it was going is forest and rivers.  I don&rsquo;t remember what prompted me to look in that direction but, when I saw it I pulled my vehicle over and got out.  My girlfriend was following me in her car and I attempted to flag her down so she could see it too but, she just waved at me.  I stood on the side of the road and observed the craft for about 3-4 minutes until it was out of my sight.  There was no sound being emitted from the craft.  I was racking my brain trying to figure out what it was; it wasn&rsquo;t a modern aircraft that I knew of because there is nothing I know of that can move that slow and stay in flight except helicopt! ers, but they create a lot of rotor wash and noise.  The craft had 3 lights on it, that I could see. I could only make out the shape, not the color as it was dark so all I could make out was a silhouette from the moon light.  I can only speculate on the size, I guess it was about 100m in length.When I got where I was going I told my girlfriend what I saw and asked her if she had seen it.  She hadn&rsquo;t and she thought I was just waving at her.  Her mother and friend asked me if I had any missing time. I guess that&rsquo;s a sign of abduction, who knows.  There wasn&rsquo;t any missing time. Once it was gone from my sight I got in my truck and drove off.I was in highschool at the time, now in the military.  I am totally guessing on the year.  It had to be between 1997 and 1998.  I&apos;m pretty sure it was in the fall.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))"
"My husband and I didn&apos;t believe in UFO&apos;s until we actually saw one!It was a warm summer evening, around 7:30 P.M.  My husband was home and my babies were in their cribs sleeping.  I went to the bathroom window to remove my clothes off the clothesline.  I had to stand on the edge of the tub to take in my clothes, and in the far off skyline, I noticed a very large orange sun which meant it was going to be very hot the next day.  I stopped what I was doing and looked at the sky, and  admired it.  Often in the daytime, when hanging out my clothes, when it was clear out, I could actually see the top of the Empire State Bldg.  Anyway, as I looked at the skyline, I noticed blinking lights, and the object was zig zagging coming closer and closer.  It was quite far away, so it was small, and the closer it got, the more curious I became.  I went into the hallway of our apartment building and went up to the roof.  As I watched the object get closer and closer, I called out to my husband and he came up to the roof.  As the object came closer, we could see it was silver and it looked like there were lights of different colors going round and round, like the top of a police vehicles light.  I ran down and got my neighbor and she came up and we looked up in the sky.  As the object approached us, it kind of tilted and it then looked like a round shaped disk, and the sound it emitted was a swishing sound.  It cam around and went to the left of  us, and it stopped.  When it stopped, the swishing sound stopped and their was a humming sound like a motor.  I noticed windows in the center of the object, and what we thought were different colored panes, was instead, there was some sort of lights changing colors and it was rotating inside of the craft.  We noticed then two rods, on each end of the craft.  They were facing downwards.  We looked up mesmerized and we asked each other if we could figure out what it was, and we were just dumfounded.  After what seemed like 10 or 15 mins. the rods disappeared and the object which had become an oval shape took off zig zagging and wit! hin seconds it disappeared from sight.  When the object took off, the motor stopped and there was a swishing sound.  We were dumbfounded.  We went down to our apartment, my neighbor who didn&apos;t speak English, but Italian, I spoke with her as that is my language and she said she never saw anything like it.  My husband went into one room and I in another and we both drew what we saw.  We drew the identical thing.  We decided to call the Civil Aironautics Bureau, and they kept me on the phone about an hour asking me questions.  They asked me not to call the newspapers or the radio media.  We didn&apos;t call anyone else nor did we tell anyone else.  The very next day, we looked in the newspaper to see if there was any article of what we saw the evening before and there was none.  We we eventually moved away to upstate N.Y.  This was in 1963.  After living there awhile, one evening we watched T.V. and saw a program which showed a couple who claimed to be abducted on board a UFO, and they had been hypnotised and they described the object.  We could hardly believe our eyes when we saw the same object we had seen that evening in the Bronx.  We then knew we had seen something that was from outer space, a UFO.  From then on, I know in my heart that there are space vehicles of other planets.  I no longer feel those who  report UFO sightings that they are imagining or not being truthful.  Thank God my husband had been home that evening and saw what I did, for it he wasn&apos;t there, he wouldn&apos;t have believed me.  This is the truth, and even though it was a very long time ago, it is something I will never forget.  One more thing, when the object took off, it went into the direction of Orchard Beach.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))"
