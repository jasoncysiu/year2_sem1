This paper attempts to answer the question of how much of its current production a gold producer should hedge by forward selling. We develop a model which allows a company manager to determine the optimal (profit-maximising) hedge, and an estimate of the risk of company failure, based on an estimate of the forward price of gold; the mine’s operating costs; and the company’s tolerance to debt. The model is illustrated with data drawn from historical gold prices and recent Australian company data. By simulating multiple instances of companies operating with different degrees of forward selling under varying levels of volatility in the price of gold, it was shown that the optimal degree of forward selling increased as volatility increased. The model allows managers to gain insights into the effect of volatility on a company’s return given its particular cost structure which in turn, supports more informed decision making. The model illustrates why, during the recent period of constant growth and low volatility in gold prices, gold producers are reducing their hedge books.
