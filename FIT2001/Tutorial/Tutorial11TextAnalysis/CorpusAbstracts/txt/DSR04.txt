The cost of monitoring and keeping the location of a Moving Query updated is very high, as the calculation of the range query needs to be re-evaluated whenever the query moves. Many methods have been proposed to minimize the computation and communication costs for the continuous monitoring of Moving Range Queries. However, because this problem has been only partly solved, more radical efforts are needed. In response, we propose an efficient technique by adopting the concept of a safe region. The safe region is an area where the set of objects of interest does not change. If a moving query is roaming within the safe region then there is no need to update the query. This paper presents efficient techniques to create a competent safe region to reduce the communication costs. We use Monte-Carlo simulation to calculate the area of the safe region due to the irregularity of its shape. As long as the query remains inside its specified safe region, expensive re-computation is not required, which reduces the computational and communication costs in clientâ€“server architectures.
